You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell anywhere.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went through to bleed every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
for three years.
I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to do it please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the monitored and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there was my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water almost 60 meters and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on the other <unk> of the year after year.
The <unk> are born when they come from glaciers or break the ice barriers.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give themselves to the end of the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, by looking at a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I am breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg as an iceberg releases fresh water into minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was out of the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they'll never exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very often going to be able to see an iceberg <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> out of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg the iceberg is a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single child, a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close into the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about understanding in it, you're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity I have two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way that people would look at the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies, human bodies -- how have the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> from patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working for example, with twins <unk> two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male and conventional female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> in many ways.
I'm going to put a few examples of ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the regular or female forms.
For example, the case is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene on the chromosome is telling the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we have <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there's high testosterone levels but not reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops in following a course as a <unk>
When you look at the baby with a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's a young girl.
And so often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After testing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body which is called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women as I -- I think a female woman, I don't know her <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman of most women as me are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> she had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a boy and had just found out that he had <unk> and a <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the <unk> glands were so active that they were essentially creating a male.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component as typically a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have caused medical medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors found that it was a woman in it.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is, they have <unk> tissue in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are <unk> twins or <unk> twins are <unk> to surgeries <unk> not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we went through several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is largely based on the idea that a particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> <unk> means to have African anatomy in historic terms.
<unk> idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very distinctive ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in a same body.
The most peak case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in fabric of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called them to wonder: "What the test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists that don't exist such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that nature doesn't draw a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it goes to science, we have to admit that these categories -- we thought that these categories -- we thought they were <unk> <unk> categories that will be <unk> directly with <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk>
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science we get deeper and more into a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> to when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put up a pen in front of the nose and he moved still not to get it.
If I stopped moving on the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extracting vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And, as a consequence, we have to deal with a dilemma of trying to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be celebrating someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
They assumed that these categories are much more fragile than we thought I was thinking about.
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of my Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did -- that I find each other watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
Parents -- <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were doing, it was a <unk> concept, and we had it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remember, what our Founding <unk> is the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The <unk> monarchs didn't know about the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to read from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents -- I was rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They went through the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- science <unk>
And there is very clear, if you look at the history of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of the explanations for, and so they were thereby <unk> the concept of being able to make a kind of vague idea of birth of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at you, for example, the Declaration of <unk> and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happens next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement came with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
So again, people of color people who are <unk> to <unk> coincidence about the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should go back to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old were supposed to be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that are <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before -- June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary got to attribute all of the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right to the vote, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because after later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, in virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the mandatory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for his part, don't have the same rights of marriage in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still took <unk> categories that are in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do it.
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man -- no one has to have a chromosome to get married with a woman you have to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't test tests to people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you about the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents from modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I love <unk> <unk> <unk>
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems to be very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to deal with this for rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people of 40 who I know.
So how do we put the theme of content on <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an MRI maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels like for other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless they are willing to submit to a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done to light <unk> to then pick them out and <unk> their name.
But when he asked the phone, I asked the fact that the operation of the operation, was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore she had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it has considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more involvement on the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
Tell me, what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the youngest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I think of your question, there is some female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something else between the female brain and the male who makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while Parents were very aware of finding the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that we have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy down beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city of <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound <unk> if you never thought about new cities.
But we just took off by the buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those people who wanted to live in apartments already were owners, and that the other half still will not be able to do that.
You could try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and causes our construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, and build a completely new apartment building always and when the norms of that place were going to build the construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that the governments were going to take new reform zones to hold large enough reform and gave them a name: cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of insects.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a constitutional crisis. <unk>
In the following elections in <unk> <unk> <unk> had a platform that <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to be his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk to TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and be bothered to all of the current residents of apartments.
It will be a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as well as for <unk> and usually they are the norms that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala he sent him to <unk> a link to <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me to me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we came together in Miami, it in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that would take the rules that would be stored there, and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way to our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was going to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The face of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go out that it could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away from the north side.
And they also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from countries that would help them to establish and make rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could easily contemplate a thousand square miles.
And shortly after the 19 o'clock in January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his constitution. and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this pristine crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk>
All of them parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting -- to <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting voting on the 21st of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> was the two places in the world who are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> of the city that's built in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country was interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, so practical -- this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second town.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> and they would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> urban builders, which are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to move on the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to their family to go to work -- they are sometimes mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like in building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public and is that I live obsessed with <unk>
And I love to find these, and more recently, photograph and post in my blog and colorful <unk> and different <unk>
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets and <unk> shops.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> shops allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it in my personal search search search.
What am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would call for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I wanted.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I figured I'd be able to find everything else that I would like to use after I get to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman who walks at TED in <unk>  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you the set for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost can see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get married, you can also tell you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at it that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> Really six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a unique personal style and unique form of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply because what I was using.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to be obsessed with these things, because in the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I go on.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the part intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where does your brain look at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As one intuition that may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it will always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking bar taught him a worthy lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed that quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play the particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody else saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be on the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's found right at the center.
And then we get a good focus on the small <unk> of metal.
So what we see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and that <unk> supported by a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a <unk> chip, and I put it to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this bore bore hole that you find under the device.
This device has the ability to be in an quantum <unk> but for it that needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an only elevator -- I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up up up, I just stop doing those things, because I don't want them to do it, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of <unk> objects are not only -- it's the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They put the lights on the lights and then you get a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then they put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, as being in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like that.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way he <unk> was like an breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft, <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that will not go at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that one <unk> thing would be <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you like you as well?
I mean, it's my part of the logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do your consciousness act if your body would be embedded in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned on the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently apparently all objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all of the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound chunk of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who's here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 and 18 months.
There are a lot of negotiations and stories, they were going to take it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education -- I don't know me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
I better show you the demo and then explain a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery. The <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, at the <unk> the New York City museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the plane, and with one click, we jumped in.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall, right?
They continue to go ahead. It's <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows you the image, click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixel pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixel pixels.
It can zoom around around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to make it <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further down and you'll see that you can really get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to remove the image, so you'll really see what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find out details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece of work.
It gets it up and actually make it up.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I believe that for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really doesn't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is "You did this to replicate the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel ...
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin -- all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened to be very interesting in violent careers in the last two decades.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you gained the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, it takes care of control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're turning computers into the open.
And, as <unk> are starting to respond differently and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note here, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption is up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost every existing atoms will become sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it into Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said screaming, <unk> non <unk> which is not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity contained in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the early afternoon there are people here and there are <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a quick call for a rapid <unk>
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night all went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everybody went to the center of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume.
Today, we know everything about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how do they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag on what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started to <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on things and complicated things are going on and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we simply didn't go away, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we dropped one day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change in <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came to us that Spain and the South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop is, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you land the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows -- but when you approach it is open for you to happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture disappears.
Here it is running.
You see people who are going on in.
And here I'm myself trying to not be able to just test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let you go to you -- but a building that was still making breaks and holes in water, and you had to jump to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as designers, designers, designers, we always think of use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels of water, and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal <unk> in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could have a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get close, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When light turns out, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine one of them being controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best dancers of ballet today, the star in New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its own 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can turn the whole movement.
You can go all the way around.
And once we have the pixels and play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our environment as a <unk> farm as a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, of the power of motion of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something that was built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new <unk>
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could better improve it for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in better shape, to be stronger <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the thing that <unk>
What would you like, if they could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people do you accept creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people in the present.
That's very good.
How many of you chose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel pretty well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at one end, is, of course, what interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is an amazing environment for those bacteria.
It's warm hot inside, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to want without any effort to be.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush to the output.
But for the other thing, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we care about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
It meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single and unique <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty in biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms -- every cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two <unk> cells.
But when <unk> organisms begin to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I was like, well, <unk> <unk> death of <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits their door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent light dancing dancer, a clothes.
He looks at him and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "Okay, George, says, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of passing the genome into the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us go into the sea.
I think that all <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily help longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would see if there were fish there, cold fish in the empty space, yet they've managed to do that an inorganic environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead at the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, by the way, <unk> <unk> and we were so excited about it that no longer is possible to have the isolation that we have to happen.
One second possibility is that it produces an evolution of the traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they are <unk>
And as soon as it comes to <unk> as a <unk> planets are going to exist, and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a attractive, intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes on at the individual and family level.
Think also that if it was possible to be able to choose not only sex from their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or to reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and he was 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year in 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 and in a week.
Not to be a lot to get the human genome to reality, and it will actually be more and more and more and more and more and more to the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses not only are going to protect us from themselves but they are going to immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course with the vaccine against flu -- on cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two other little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes, eliminate reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that the same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also take <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the <unk> of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to develop before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good for worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about with flight.
So they immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot was already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
It would take the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words that I've heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to come and didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to do is all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I was thinking about that further, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to bring it up.
I don't want to give you anything in life.
And that matter, that by the way, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I had -- the George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes have tried to improve on everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time you were going to do in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a result, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't really try to have it right, <unk> be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to be <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I came back, I had the feeling of, Whoa! I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- the first grade, not a lot of artistic talents ...  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
It was given me a miracle of not dying that day.
And I was given a little gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live in another way.
You who are flying in today, the challenge for you to imagine that the same happens in your airplane -- and please not be the way -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that they are expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How can you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of <unk> projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today we have total paralysis, have total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation company that, obviously, the graffiti is kind of intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided we were going to go back to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate to me."
And I said, "A second, is not that I saw Stephen <unk> -- not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be somebody important and you have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way -- they're going marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and rather than that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how she was going to <unk>
I would join me with his brother and his father there at that particular moment, "All right, this is the Tony <unk> it's going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get back to your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw about that and record negative space.
So they go out there making art facility like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First, they start with sexual organs -- then on the bad words, after with attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things from one side to another we had a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't do it." This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world from every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids, and I move to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken off the frames of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks we were <unk> we went to my son <unk> my son was part of me, and I created this.
It's called <unk>
These are a pair of <unk> sun that we buy on the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it on a light of LED -- we put it on one light of LED -- and now there's a device that is free -- we published the <unk> code, the software is low for free.
And we created a device that doesn't have the limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person's room and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of planning about high school sessions from all night, Tony got to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot in the hospital.
And he went back to drawing the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust out in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go around with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a Hudson <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it more quickly and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine acknowledged us as one of the 50 major inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up close -- the <unk> is that in April of this year in <unk> <unk> in Los Angeles -- there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything from this room.
I'm not a programmer, I was never a programmer, I did nothing with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and I was fascinated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, you know, if it's not now, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat just a lot of fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in horrific situations with a lot of social issues to be able to look at social questions in ways that make interesting attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What there was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be made in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I couldn't do it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be given to me -- nothing could be done for something so dangerous or as dangerous as we entered the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with <unk> marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest film ever <unk> is that everything from top at the bottom, in principle, he has lots of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> a film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the brand of the brand of X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we have all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever made any better than you ever had any <unk> of "The largest movie <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, make them that <unk> the <unk> <unk> to cause the <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The film of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the movie -- beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because this is the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how to <unk> people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- how much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half a half and a half a half -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meet them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big markings on them.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie was going to look at us like a lot of idiots -- <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: So two things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the past media scenario is not the idea of that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
No, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image is about.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images showing up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> that are characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices, being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it's trying to make it really a place it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives rise to --  -- like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
It would be a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> history.
We want you to make a story -- but we have <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father got me in some lie -- and there he was looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the history <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take the proxy and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to notice is that what I started to warn you, is that when you start to talk to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the awful brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you make you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man like <unk> solid, <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to get the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: It's higher <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you fresh, more <unk> more <unk> three times more cool.
Things like those who will <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What are there about a common?
I need to talk to the guy from the street, people like me, to the <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Okay. What's the <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the type of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
And usually I carry accessories as sunglasses, or <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: So I think <unk> partly <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the pet guy.
We give toys toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: 5: <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but I often believe myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your sense of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that you think about like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and in my case come and start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me from the <unk> to what does that serve us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
I was absolutely crazy at all.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or on the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to have -- and it's the natural nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them a positive thing, for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks, those things that have gone and come and come on, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to raise your identity, your brand, your brand, what would be?
You're a <unk> You are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more an attribute <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being cool as the <unk> contemporary game, and bold or bold or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or mystical or mystical <unk>
Or are you more of attribute <unk>
Are you conscious of sophisticated <unk>
Are you rich, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're a <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise people like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film that you now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and for a movie for a film.
We went to San Paulo where you've banned advertising at the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting into the way in schools with oil problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest response or the ones that I've been working on is those in which I've sought to interact with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to challenge people to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? they succeed?
Well, since the film was sent off in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent back in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
This takes only a two-year period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because it's almost all the agencies that we talk about with their customers not to be a part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get people out of that being pushing it to failure.
I think when you train their employees in <unk> the risk is preparing for your entire company for <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who had the name of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So we were in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED record, the Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they are completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a effective virus on Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, damages the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission.
Is it easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
That really struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they got very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experience different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place: right?
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could you say for example, a power plant in the U.S. or a chemical plant in Germany.
Would you better take the goal soon.
So we pulled up and forth and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that there were very armed armed with people who obviously had the entire internal information.
They will get all the points for the ones to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and <unk> let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were calls in terms of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and structures of data and tried to deal with the real world, with potential potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about recipients we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's certainly a <unk> white white white <unk> and it's certainly in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
You don't find several targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that a mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> by looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> is <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
For it not <unk> it wasn't like this.
And the results have been from the results of a lot of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we found that both of both digital <unk> they were going to only one and same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six water and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about the other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw, I really <unk>
There's the gray box, and there you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is to intercept the input values for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides the genomic code, which is still running through the attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by <unk>
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the room in control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the vast steam turbine is going down, you have to be able to open escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, basically.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> not the security system and the security system.
It scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
It would be more possible as possible.
And if you made that, with what you do -- it's a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we can start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main thing behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because in other ways, our problems would be still larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can lead and give you a lot of skills that will make you out of wheelchair chairs and go back to walk.
In <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, it gives you a great force -- which is also increases in your speed, and helps for example, managing the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connected it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on their back to a <unk> load of <unk> and it's got to get a lot more apart.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds for a piece of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of lawn chairs on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people on the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the world's population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a lot of young people -- very young people, in the spinal cord to start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that over the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I may recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column, and as a result was unable to walk for 19 years now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely <unk> on crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and make it progress with this smooth and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a weird jump in the air, skiing down the air down the <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement <unk> down.
Shortly after, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you'll never come up to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
That's how I stole to the last little bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down at <unk> climbing rocks and even ride in a <unk>
But you've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential to change the lives of future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of chairs to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the New Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created a special thing, because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an area of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction is also putting the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation is that you can't fill and a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can hear the hidden laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> -- because they have <unk> sex and <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play through their entire life.
Play is not just a children.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game of Bonobo -- Bonobo sees the same <unk> the same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the <unk>
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a ball of ball <unk> and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is so much in Bonobos and in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where wonder.
And I want you to say this -- this is <unk> a young female who's playing with fresh water.
I think that as it does, sometimes we play by alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And this playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a more and harder world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt it to a world that changes we have to play.
But do it <unk> our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate play, they can be the kind of <unk>
So <unk> <unk> accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> <unk> as a captain of captain in a moving fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers are propelled to a highly skilled personnel you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But still there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has certainly been through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and asked her to go out and save the owner of the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, for the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people who walked into a <unk> building to save a live building, just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to be <unk> <unk> fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was waiting for, but I was able to put up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> <unk> that at that height or less had finished off the fire and walked into the front room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> out of the house for the owner of the house owner where, as I would expect, his treasure trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department was given a letter from the house owner for the brave effort to be shown to save her home.
The kindness that she watched over the other was that someone had reached her even a couple of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling of <unk> voluntary acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of <unk> and courage acts of <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done it, or are there for <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you -- I don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
You have food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So I went to <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the more building unit used in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called a brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that have been made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply took the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental part of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> aesthetic world, stacked to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete, the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I don't personally know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking power from engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best of everything is that they attach it through magnets.
So you can't get wrong in the wrong way.
<unk> have a piece of color.
The green is the exit, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is wire.
So you only have to assemble one green with one green and very quickly, you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with a green one green produce light.
Can we put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that is here, and we now have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower <unk> just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growth.
We want all the interactions in the world to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how do you work a night, or why the door to an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, the designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see here, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island School of Rhode Island School who has no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which has fear of darkness.
For these <unk> engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to the reach of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go to the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is ours.
So forward and things.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for getting involved with the environment focusing on.
We distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video better at one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a few <unk> of Peace <unk>
I took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to the Third World and we send them to the wild.
They took big <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I was looking for a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody has to cut it down when it is trapped by snow, because you know it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he come to ask for help in this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: <unk> citizens <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case put him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component of uprising.
It's a modest application.
It may be the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But does something that no other technology from the U.S. government.
And it spreads in viral.
A responsible for systems of <unk> city to see this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work in the tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why she asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens of the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just finished <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use use using it.
And this has been <unk> without <unk> and natural fashion.
If you know a little government technology will know that this doesn't normally happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that it was done by the normal channels, it would have taken at least two and extra two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the court power of California that up to the moment, 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that has a couple of days, and it was <unk> in viral shape is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the local government, better ways to work, not as in private enterprises, like a lot of people think it should be.
Nor do a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
It's not given to the government.
They feel a big frustration but they don't get out of that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they put crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it's not <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately <unk> of us -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way it thought it will affect the way of producing change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the telephone care center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined <unk> at the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web and a mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They don't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the cube of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income in government income to collaboration volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to two people.
And it might have been connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think one is the input of the other.
The government to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will bring our values to our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 feet.
That's why we call it <unk>
And we tell that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds us out of that that actually belongs to us that we financed as something that is operating on our against that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
Have you been <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- this is a activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> us to the government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get out of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology to root the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- I am a larger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express their views in any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when the government problem doesn't care about making their voices lot.
They're using your hands.
They bring the hands to the work to program applications that make it work better.
And those applications that allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking away by <unk> dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and lots of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not just consumers that pay tax and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all of us together, we're going to be a crowd of voices, or also to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons.
I've spent the most part of my life in communities that were involved in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia and <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit small and I would look at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so hard I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching me, and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I would love it again and if I said that yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always ask you to be near to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I was woke up one morning, I went to the room and there was all cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at him and <unk> and she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, went up through the room, and he said, "Come <unk> I got my hand and said, "Come on. We are two to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said to me, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now he <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I looked at my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> this is how I did it."
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to ask me is that you're always going to do the right thing if you look at the right thing.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want to tell me is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I was like, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern rural. I have a brother and an sister a year smaller.
When I was 14 to 15, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> got me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just get a <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister also.
I said, "No, I'm not feeling good. You can <unk>
And then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
He broke the look in the face of strength and <unk> "Oh, you're not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I say it for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be able to get it out.
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is now very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 billion.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young people are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The policy of fear and anger make us believe that these are not all of us.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some good developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you become a <unk> criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black man has lost the right to vote.
And if we introduce it to the next 10 years that the loss of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before they had the law of the right to the vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was known to be 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country jail for children, no possibility to come out again.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, they have given us to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we're in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Out of nine people <unk> has identified one who is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from the death row.
A error, <unk> an innocent person in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to fly planes if in every nine who would be <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction of the rebuilding and that lasted to World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> people who stop saying that in our history of deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. We grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was, obviously, with segregation and decades of it to allow race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we get together with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage us with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and he said, "You know that it's well disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> It's not <unk> in Germany.
We will never be here."
The room was silent and a woman said, "There is no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and we were going to run the people."
So let's look at this.
How would we feel in a world like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in mostly <unk>
We couldn't get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these very difficult issues, the positive things are -- though, the positive and wonderful things they are.
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are being made by suffering, the abuse, the abuse, the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
Now, we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside of our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational so deeply committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> it is also dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering with <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation to the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even as TED, has to be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> for injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, and being a very young lawyer from knowing Rosa <unk>
These women were all gathered to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and get <unk>
I was like, "Be lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk> them.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks turned to me and said, "Now, <unk> ask me that this idea of <unk> justice is.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I began to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences sentences for life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death <unk>
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At the time, Ms. <unk> got me <unk> he put her finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if anybody takes something that doesn't belong, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
And so I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it is very <unk> very beautiful, <unk> <unk> that we don't judge our technology, for our designs, and for our rational.
In the end, the character of a society, not for the way that they treat the rich and powerful, but as they deal with the poor, they sell the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> to be told as adults as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge was going on as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake in <unk> My God, if the judge can turn you into something that you are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a small, black <unk>
I began to work on <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated as a <unk> privileged <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> conduct in <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, I was not only <unk> but he had sent to court.
It took about two months, I had already forgotten.
And I finally said, "My God, I have to go to cut this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went on the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped from the car. He went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black black man -- he was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I walked up and approached me.
And I put myself into the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That is deeply connected with me with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we start to discuss.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors all <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people, all infuriated because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked through the window and try to hear all that <unk>
He was walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black <unk> in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> <unk> showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood up and looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man who keeps his view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot truly be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of design, design and creativity must be addressed to the <unk> and <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, I simply want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you hear and see a very clear desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something is not a check.
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to make a <unk> effort that you spend today in political policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to get the law to do security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not crimes of violence.
It's the wrong thing about the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population of the population.
And we allowed us to convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against ownership instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our ongoing philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited to be <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats by Bin Laden's dead.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police shine O.C. gas.
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk>
<unk> six: <unk> <unk> <unk> 65 dead.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Several <unk> War.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Egypt.
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can get.
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient segment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector the detector in danger.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So of a <unk> stories to look at the negative ones.
That old saying, "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices provide us with negative news, the seven days per week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that let's be <unk>
It doesn't surprise that people think that the world will be wrong with worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is rooted in such a way that we have the potential to create an abundance world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> the scarcity of water and <unk> and <unk>
As human beings are very good for us to deal with the problems, and in the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has become more than <unk> average income per capita income for inflation has <unk> throughout the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and transportation has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened 25 percent over 80 percent over 80 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would get it.
And we continue to make it more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, <unk> television, mobile TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
It is a lot of this technology -- and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law is about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the resulting computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is at least faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell ourselves today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel -- the fuel and the food, the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial artificial intelligence in the cloud, which is available for every cell phone.
Four years ago, I here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can be positively <unk> the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean creating <unk> life for every inhabitant on the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
He went back to dinner the king of <unk>
Napoleon <unk> <unk> with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk> of aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the roof to Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came out and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as it was <unk>
So let's give it this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about resource <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about hobbyists but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the produced by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents <unk> by hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have a abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan targeted the spacecraft to the spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
It was a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source source, saltwater, water <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke has just noticed that I'm going to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that would be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior warrior -- has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video, video, images, libraries of books and music, technology technology now are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe it gets the best thing to get when you get health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce to the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> you can extract blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent and there's health workers at the health.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give up the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we spend two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that we add to global conversation.
What would these people?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the highest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy and healthy <unk>
What about the voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be heard of the first time?
What do you do?
And if they're contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X X is that small equipment -- guided by their passion with a clear goal -- can do things that were going to just make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that probably some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at Stanford University, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds called the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together and started <unk>
And it has been shown now that the pattern of human pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, that gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we have been focused on to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades in front of a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make a while.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it so far to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see about <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 miles, a black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so he was getting over the middle in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped to half.
I go to the five centimeters.
We have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe conducted a lot of developing projects.
<unk> development was meant to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat is pretty ugly, he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the Sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was something we captured was <unk>
<unk> I now know, sea floor.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny spots on some of the remains that are a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start commercial fisheries.
The bottom line of being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
It wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to do it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what fishermen are collected every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there is no <unk>
We don't remember.
It was going to look at the start on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things that are providing biodiversity, many of the <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and would extrapolate to go.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk> of change.
And at the end of the end you keep some <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before we get older, it's <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea is synonymous with big fish.
They become little <unk> because the <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like captain just like captain such as a captain of the fish in this area can't be used -- or generally they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can be able to fulfill a marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and is extremely low.
That's for people who can see a marine marine zone, and they can benefit from vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do that because they have no access, like the Middle West, for example?
I think there are arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made a virus and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, it seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And, of those, just a little percentage of each other, gets a myriad of views and making cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this <unk> video in the National Park, National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows you <unk> in the rise of popularity last summer.
<unk> didn't get to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this request that <unk> the <unk>
The trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented to some new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to get the end of week, the weekend.    <unk> on a Friday.  KA: That would not think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows how often we use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened on this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or an creators group takes a point of view, and they share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a version version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats seeing the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today it's not just <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Black or Black or Black <unk>
What to script might have written this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, just that truly unique and unexpected can be able to make it out of the way these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I had a <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that are preventing you with properly <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million of you see and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth of all the new things that we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of there were creative communities, creative communities, are completely unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't use permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the features of the old media features -- it's just the current media -- but let's build the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so much time my friends, I now get it.
They were <unk> in silence.
She died broken by history.
This is my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was to learn that the story was to learn from <unk> but we would do it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn at dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
In order for her, life was meant to a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat washed up into the sea dressed as <unk>
All adults knew about risks.
The biggest fear were <unk> rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
So if we first came back, we would take my sister first, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the horizon vast and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came up several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not to be able to rip out for six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I would end the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I set out because of the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, we would see in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class that the population is composed of immigrants from immigrants from.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the rights.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments of English was <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> from the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra ticket in English and <unk> wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be <unk> who generally was <unk> <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was <unk> <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home. Where is that?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were focusing on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares start to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition, angry and <unk> and boys stuck between two worlds.
They looked subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was a classic classical, relentless with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of they had help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of healthier, elected the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
As <unk> resident anonymous resident in <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist who was talking to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence would never have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we climb up the boat.
Nothing had been an option.
He said, "What would you not be <unk>
So I spoke about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly talking, the more I was to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
So there had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly new <unk> in the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that is being grateful, -- maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being in it it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was an energy there, which is a <unk> optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
They brought into a small group of people who <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up step.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before we end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 percent became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
It cannot prove to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room, when she died, a <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell him stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body, so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from <unk> he said.
They haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life was built up, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could do that for you?
I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a <unk> a brave rate of the engine, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon we don't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and watch them do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We do it with airplanes.
In that time, when I was born, the great Indian ancient prince -- he had <unk> pull out a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And so I was very excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic with magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me a gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras keep it to you.
We have our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I was sent to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device capable of connecting to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, music and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live to the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child gets excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood, those ideas that I <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned to me exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to liberate the fireflies.
And, really, you light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy, in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world gets into a <unk> that I drag to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of our fantasy there's always maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they are also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian and Indian content, and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been stuck in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a young child story.
In a story that deals today like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out abroad, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't.
So to recover this childhood ritual we have to go out and, in a chapter, we have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a lump of cortex and then <unk>
In this way, you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
In the ways of connecting between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on, and through augmented reality -- sees a group of cartoons that appear on the interior plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves <unk>
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are coupled with technology and magic and technology are closer to another.
We use the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and love and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects are <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a conductor of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family, family, and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and closed command.
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I set up the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that he needs to be <unk> or an urgency of that style -- but it looks backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
It was next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are born from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to recover the control and to be captains of its own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing care costs of attention and <unk> and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video with you.
We all have <unk> navigation <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where computers are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up at the <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was looking for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use their iPhone, and then the next few weeks to use your cell phone phone to find the closest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce you this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to do it globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in place.
Please wake up in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography is woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing before, but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when <unk> the <unk>
So let's call it a building on a very large <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> darkness, and colorful to the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the virus levels.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to seem captured in some way as photography.
So let me have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to see with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here are three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as though it was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's get into the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture of a picture of it, I think they are those in which they don't even have the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But when we combine pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect voice.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of pictures of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that find it because you don't need to put in danger of the ideas that has in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter knew that I had several months to figure out the different locations for the <unk> parts.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The coast is a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, even I made a red house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you can take the result it can be quite beautiful, and at the time you have very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start by showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
So please, if you can <unk>
This is a diagram anybody I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details -- but the overall thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing on the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other people we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> line.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves <unk> it's something new.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we do these technological curves.
The answer is that if drawing on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to take on -- the diagram would see something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a curve, that would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something is something like this, you give a change <unk>
If the technology of <unk> transport as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological growth of a <unk> growth that every single few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
And we had one of two things.
Or it's good to become a typical curve I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think it might happen something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me is, what is that new way that embraces the world?
What's the world <unk>
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember that a child was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how that transition could be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance away and look at things in the long term.
The scale of the time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back over two and millions of years when the Earth was a big rock rock with lots of chemicals that they would take around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals organized those chemicals together as we came up in.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that at that time, there was floating some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical prescriptions inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring together materials from the outside and so the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those blobs weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they would get a distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
That's why every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that in some way becomes better at the time of bringing the chemicals. <unk> more, <unk> more chemists and more <unk>
Mostly they lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a form of chemical life, very simple chemistry, but things will become interesting when these droplets learned the trick of the abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep the information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to record them.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it has been 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred white dust that I'm trying to hide to the airport security.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we usually used to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and we would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step came up in which things are very different, and that was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information forming the cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that in a way, they were together on it, and record a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were more <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities became so close that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the entire recipe in the community board on a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another one billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that no longer act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or from the muscles or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that don't make more than process information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those are the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as a <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not a period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because she knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of it.
So the fact that the nervous system build those information structures to accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution might now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in his heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, into sound, and we make something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms, our <unk> display and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together on something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we have accelerated at time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next couple of you, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
And then the following language, etc., they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like the electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that leverages its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve, the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complex complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we thought a level of abstraction and put it in the machine and the machine with that makes something that I didn't want to, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the genomic scale.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please your computer, you can run a hundred million instructions on <unk>
You could run these <unk> instructions to random, running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to give you a simple example.
So we find the programs that are more often closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random random sequences of instructions, give them numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, was able to put two numbers in the order of the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
They put those together and <unk> the rest.
And now we're going to make the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs that <unk> children, who are <unk> and that the children will take the properties of both of these programs.
So we get a new generation of programs out of the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's take it again.
I would take some mutations together.
And it tries to go back and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation is taking a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in some complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that sequence numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to use them to see how they work.
They're dark programs. They're strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they get the target because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he goes, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a flight. You don't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering effect.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes ahead of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a moment of analog to the organisms that are happening when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to let me give you some of my <unk> <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk about a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm just focusing on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> than 300.
That means the bat <unk> three times 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to deal with the first base, it didn't get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, you really know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody than 10 car <unk> They hit four.
<unk> like Professor Ted Williams, the last player in the Women's League of <unk> to run more 400 strikes in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear self has two clogged <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose <unk> <unk> is 200 <unk>
But know what?
She's getting better than this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you think must be the average of hits of a cardiac surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, pretty well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I included, with the term <unk>
That never, would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
And that was the message that I would say when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a couple of high school said that Brian Sachs was studying up to a blood test.
Such which.
It was <unk> in my little <unk> in the General in the General in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
Out of my anatomy, of anatomy, the origin and the <unk> the <unk> the spin-off of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the political diagnosis and the <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were born, then it would know everything, or more possible, to close to everything, because I would love with mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was saying to a cardiologist to say to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
and inform the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, the blood goes to the lungs, and that's why it's hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read about.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on her heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water, so that it could get rid of liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring the information back.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to spend constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even touching my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
He sent her home, he didn't take attention to a voice on my inside that would say, <unk> not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so sure that I was able to ask the nurse that I would give her to the Catholic lady -- "Do you think he's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think being right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he wrote the high and the ambulance with the ambulance with the ambulance with her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I followed my work.
At the end of the day, I was going to leave to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot where I was my car to go home. So I did something I don't do normally,
It happened for the emergency room service home.
And there was another nurse, not that I took from Mrs. <unk> before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors have been <unk>
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the <unk> patients.
The three words is: Do you remember you?
"He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And he said, "You know, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
In an hour of an hour to come back to her house, and after I was given the high school, he suffered a collapse, and his family called the <unk> the ambulance was brought to the emergency room with a blood pressure on <unk> which means a severe shock to it.
Just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff will spread all their resources.
They gave up medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and waiting against all the hope that it was <unk>
And in the two or three days next to it was obvious that I never <unk>
He had permanent <unk>
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were going on to what was happening.
And by the ninth day, they let her go. The <unk> lady and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks ago, I was inspired by that and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt lonely, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame <unk> that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we made was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't get stuck.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why he sent your home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake that <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> opened the sky and finally went the sun. And I wondered if I'd feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in the same way that if you go to the efforts to be perfect to do not make any more mistakes, I would make it against those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
They were running penicillin, and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked me to speak to me in his office.
And I made the three words: Does you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, it's from the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You get antibiotics for <unk> and recovered at the next few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
It turned out an X-ray of kidneys -- but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity to the lower right quadrant, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He read liquid it for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
And I checked it and see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered well.
But each case, I was hooked.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many of my colleagues say, is a <unk>
<unk> have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get it out and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do you teach them to make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard about failure, after failure, failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and whatever I know -- those who are not able to sleep and that I know; those who have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an antibody reaction as antibodies you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you make from medicine to the people who make mistakes have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years in terms of diffusion and medical journalism -- I've made a personal study from bad medical litigation and medical errors to learn how to be possible, from the first paper I wrote to the Toronto Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every day, in which one in 10 drugs are going into the hospital is wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where infection infection are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian Canadian medical errors.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so these things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added up every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, and it comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things like this.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals, you know, you won't get no one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, Art <unk> is already a custom -- say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say this is my worst <unk> I would say this is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
Your doctor is human, you know human, accept it, and they don't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They make their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not <unk> but in a loving way of loving and support for everybody to be <unk>
And he works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human, <unk> errors in mistakes.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick a half American, it's about 70 to a day.
Not long ago in a research followed by a week to a group of business.
The researchers recorded the different tasks -- for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job made lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions was nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the <unk> category, and how many of an hour?
How does the way that drive those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I do a question, if you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student from the University of Stanford, <unk> this in a very, very narrow level -- at least in that time it was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf on the <unk> oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from trees.
I decided I was going to visit a manager and I asked him, "Do you have this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists which came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment.

They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a <unk> just at the entrance to the store.
We put out there from six <unk> or a different flavors and look at two things: First, where do people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a decade ago that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Since the ones that were stopped when there was only three percent got to buy <unk>
From those who stood up when I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, you will decide that we don't buy <unk> probably less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices affect us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions for retirement savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 years of this country from this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of money offers available in savings plans for retirement savings plans to save people to save for the future.
And we found that it actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 options.
And we found that the bigger the number of funds, there were fewer participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as it wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk> 60.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, how much more people were the number of choice, more people will be supported by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the well-being financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The more likely it is to make the decision, the decision, even when it goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less than <unk> although objectively it better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choosing that amazing <unk>
Today I want to do today -- four simple techniques that we've brought in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to be cut, you get rid of getting rid of <unk> options, there's going to be a better experience in sales -- we'll have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for loss of cats that less <unk> became <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and less costs.
You know that the exploration of today, on average, they have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle the choices is this by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe insurance background.
Those who are really willing to choose, are they offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing that I do is to ask the <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't make their <unk>
This afternoon, before we started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people out of this audience, a holiday with all men paid the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk>
Isn't it more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You know that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, than in the second end, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the overload of the overload of the <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very concrete <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit card than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make them worse.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were given to a <unk> plan.
That meeting exactly as we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff to think of the positive things that they would do in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a conference of robotics.
We saw that at <unk> <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the show of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This framework is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that we would say to you not that the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I'm glad who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows us to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each other.
I have 56 little possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make the shots.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at a few hundred boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from <unk> options, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you always get the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to times, <unk> the default button over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go out of a few choices in many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was alter the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to do it.
Although the choice is not going to tell you anything about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways we make it to choose.
We're getting excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful the <unk>
And the more they careful let's be in our own choices we can practice art from choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a machine of writing it must be <unk>
So I had to record a piece of text text with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint down to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of somebody who could do this, so much that this will take the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print one page, that page page will end up having a little printed yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what's going on in the online world, we can put together, attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are we <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, large amounts.
There are actually a lot of <unk> in line, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, Anderson, and so etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy them on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> Is <unk> <unk>
And I say today it's more likely that any of us are the victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most of the crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, motivate them the protests, motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a leading role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> as Anonymous that do for protest and last group are the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of suicide attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an exit authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> last fall because of a <unk>
Let's take the safety of the site and give a <unk>
Last week, I asked the Dutch government <unk> I asked one of the leaders if we were to <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services and services like <unk>
Except that you have an foreign authority authority.
And they said <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, Egypt was <unk> the <unk> secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And inside that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 3,000 euros to the U.S. government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for the governments to do this to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's more there.
It will be connected to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these things like this obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's actually on play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right now that we will be in today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south Park, National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park National Park.
The Yellowstone National Park, it has no fences in most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it was dead because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came from heaven with our animals and all the land to protect them, and that's why we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
They were dying these are warriors who protect our community and livestock and they're also painful with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is just so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, at six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing to happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions was scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen <unk>
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to <unk> lions so they believed it was near <unk>
But lions are really intelligent.  They came the first day, and they were, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  And so he jumped and killed and killed and killed in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to turn on and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
They get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes light <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And house houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals all the lions and asked if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them. You can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, <unk> of other predators like hyenas, <unk> and also being used to <unk> elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, International International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the grasslands, of the <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and said that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer, of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on the other electric inventions here.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I would spend it once, right now, right, and I have tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every step to <unk> mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will go all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public job.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks past them.
We're putting together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
He was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't delete my memory.
One woman without life was dead, holding a child in the street, holding a child in his arms watching the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine turned out to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine -- just a few survived eating grass, insects and tree crashes.
They also became more and more rare and more rare -- all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like a refugee refugee,
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
And a day, my worst nightmare was made, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was arrested at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I put my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though it had been <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape -- many other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can be done in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but on the inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I went through a health crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with pride with pride.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the school exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities would be a little bit of money that sent my family, and, as a clue my family was going to be displaced to the force at a remote location in <unk>
They had to flee immediately away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese -- I had to take it in a way, for over 3,000 kilometers across China, and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> I took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked her everybody's identification and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all of my money in order to bribe border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or a voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would want to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary -- I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the ATM and <unk> and he gave the rest of the money for my family and another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I went through my entire heart, and I said, "Why would I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when I did it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
With the time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea, we came together.
But the freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, practice practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in touch with family in touch inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> shops and fast food, <unk> terrain.
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the Southern Center for it to represent something else, so they changed the way to Los Angeles as if this is what is actually wrong with the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles <unk> home to the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to take kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Southern Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 50 miles away.
And I was able to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of house you see the effects of the current food system that the current food system has on their <unk>
I saw wheelchair <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
I already got tired of driving a 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to town.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to get it back.
So this was how I decided to keep it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine vegetables go.
What we do, we're a kind of a group paid ahead of gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city got me on top and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I was like, "Come on it, "Come on it?
A court order for plant food on a piece of land than no one <unk>  And then I was like, "Well, I was like, "Okay, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green School who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's the equivalent of 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting millions of tomato plants.
Why on Earth does not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seed plant.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you're growing your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I'm going to become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, land like a canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You would see what the Earth can do, if they leave their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a health witness tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
It is <unk> to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative who can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, "You don't temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's the street on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to make it <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who were helped to download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous and so it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of people who are coming, working and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If kids are growing <unk> the guys will eat <unk>
If you grow some <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, they eat whatever you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're sitting on. I see these guys who are on this way that are on this road designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who were <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The cool thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work with people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
How do you get them to take your <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, you don't call me if you want to sit on lawn chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very good road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if they go on the <unk> and these cars go down, that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, you know, close to the cities, we would want a <unk> road to a <unk>
The solution for that is to make <unk> roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so all the water water flow down into the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and we don't get any water from it.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Watch that on this road, the stones on the surface are gone.
First a stone, then many more and more and more, etc., and they would say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can damage their <unk> and you're not happy with it.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to light -- the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will get the <unk> you will get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we use wool wool and steel <unk> and we can cut up the wool wool into smaller pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel in that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and the stones turn into the surface.
I used to use a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> freeway that we had to do a test lane test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the crash test, and then of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made a lot of burden we put a lot of burden we put a lot of burden on them, and we put it with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat that many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers to bring these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface. It really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how repair does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the <unk> sound in my house.
My father was listening to News with his little gray radio.
He had a big smile on his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is generally <unk>
<unk> <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were dressed in Afghanistan and they made girls in the school.
For the next five years, I was stuck as a child to <unk> my older sister -- who no longer could be used out to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, we take a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where they were going.
We had to hide the books on market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of the <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Back in a while, the school suddenly was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in the remote province of their daughter, my mother, outside to school, and so his father did it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to convert our house home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate his children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were times that I was very frustrated for our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can try to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find this proud to graduate from graduate school.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home to the courage to educate her daughters, it was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't only get away from my university degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's why we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite a opposition in <unk>
As a <unk> It's not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to her house, it's the phone, a voice <unk> that if I was still sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been the key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school is told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of the changes.
We would argue that these changes didn't happen much, after retirement retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and her parents who were <unk> for them, I see the <unk> and a durable change and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> would get me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother's who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary way, <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the massive <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a fury day and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and men who were <unk> were in the <unk> edge, each of the regime, they are carrying billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a <unk> bravery to the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 people will release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with many other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a Transition and right transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and state reconciliation and <unk>
There's about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, came to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> orientation -- to advocate to advocate for the organizational autonomy of the woman and for our law of engaging <unk> in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the menstrual period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> which was more and more of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was meant and successful.
Women were won in the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> from ancient ancient and <unk> <unk>
Another <unk> with the news of the murder of the American soul and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights abuse and their lack of respect of law.
Our society has made out of a revolutionary mindset, and it becomes more, and it's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
It stops <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all here at <unk> with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to tell you, that we, as the nation, we chose badly, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize right.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and thereby driven by men as women?
Maybe what was missing not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the election, that we just take polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the <unk> of the feminine representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and calling up a days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not just <unk> but it also puts in practice to practice <unk> <unk> collaboration with <unk> and inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic, that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which encompasses the entire humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows into the very divine matrix of compassion all the existence of it.
And then you say, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
And then he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That everybody will give them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a nasty question that has an equally <unk> question.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone is doing is that they all make a good thing. Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and I'm not an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, I would join me with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved one more than anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trick, <unk> <unk> where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University at Harvard and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies, <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been about 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all of the income levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse are men, just in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration of the families, the last place where we might or expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would be sitting with a man who was going to go through it, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other from the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by mates, and <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and Palestinian night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also had taken away from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most was that I was ready and fun, and it seemed like a kid in the field.
He had some big <unk> like blocks, and a <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me, which was list, that he had gone to Harvard who would put passion to help teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why I <unk> that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering the head of the physical, financial and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it reacts with.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we move to New England you know, that place where <unk> was supposed to be so safe to bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one was kept on the pillow in our bed and his third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that he lived old.
I needed them to feel secure.
But these guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never been able to do my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physicist physicist had happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, put my girlfriend of my mother and married me.
Despite what I'd happened, I was sure that I would live happily lived forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would make any harm.
I spent two times more on our <unk> moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong on the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our broken moon, went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> continued to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Disease reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had a lot of a company.
Going back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do because we were victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the murder in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and manipulation.
And we still ask, why is it just not going?
I was able to go to me because of one last <unk> she beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed him if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: the police, my neighbors, my family, my relatives, all of strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as the <unk> <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
And for some people is a way to say blame is it by <unk> as if the <unk> <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to them, and that they would save their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I got married with a man and cute and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What you're not going to do is never more, is a gun that was charged with my head in the hands of someone who says I want it.
At this moment, they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they're <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy crazy love breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the abuse of light talking about it with their kids, their peers, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to break down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families into the safe and <unk> who should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
It will be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like at this point there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like that.  Luckily, I've brought them clothes to <unk>
This is the first change on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of fortune <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to take care of them now, but find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by the head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed entirely what you thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and photographer would tell me that I would take the back and I would get my hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery, or an artificial tan like which I made two days ago for work, there is very little to be able to make our looks, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I am on this stage.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but you know, <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we've also been associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage, that I've known to take money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that <unk> Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- to say, less than four percent, they weren't white ...
The next question that people always ask me is, can be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take it from that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be the president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a stent <unk> ninja and poet, which would naturally be the first.
If after this <unk> list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of the <unk> American magazine, or the executive executive of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can possibly choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you put your studies, and you have a resume and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you want, if you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you have a Model pair of clothes for 10 years, people would look at it.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, you basically get all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal domain, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are from the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the first French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is <unk> for free?
I have too many graduate school, and I have never use, except the previous one, but the privilege that I get in is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a grocery store, and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> a light light in red and, of course, we had a sorry, and I was sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege as I look, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, from the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 <unk> percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young men in New York, for what for them, not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I get married, and I <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure takes to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we would do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, resourceful, and passionate people.
And that's all right, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask, with a little more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest and clothes are probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial racial situation when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you will all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures of <unk> and I didn't know what the <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, or even a minimum of care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists tourists give birth.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife got me this picture holding me up this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and <unk>
He gave the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take a <unk> to New York on a <unk> trip and you continue to <unk>
Here is when we start to ask the tourists who were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much that life would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in the way that a five-year-old could be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific trip.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when you suddenly stopped in the tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the zip store that they would copy small on earlier <unk>
And I described to me what had felt like the five years of foot in that same place.
He remembered that with their heart heart, with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of a lot of family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to show up in the picture, and I didn't want to get on to somebody and ask him, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most skilled birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs, <unk> as a characters like silly silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to the Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> World <unk> where we have 16 species -- these 16, 11 and a high risk of extinction.
So why are you <unk> <unk> First of all, provide life ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural waste.
<unk> bodies to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that wouldn't be because they would stretch and cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and Central Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> in the open culture, and in places like Tibet, there's no place to bury the dead -- or <unk> to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are the victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years away, and the reason is because they fall prey out of the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a posture.
Because there is been a <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge time bomb to <unk> The number of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a housing problem is not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise.
When you go out of this room, he tells you about <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw flying no effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I run and everything I do is I <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk> the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people to grow up to grow food.
So we got with <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the locals to grow Italians Italians Italians and ...
Of course, people were not at all all interested in doing that, so that they were afraid to come to work, and sometimes they weren't going to be --  -- we were amazed that the local people, in so fertile <unk> they hadn't had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here --  <unk> time to save the people from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red, at night at the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you have any <unk>
I was thinking that only we were all the Italians born mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they did what the English did, what they did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk>   <unk> to see the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've brought to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and treat people just two things: or <unk> or are we <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if it was my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. <unk> opened this conference on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never drive anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people, who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? Do you <unk>
It will never get a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We put together in a cafe. We sat down in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you a sense to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, but not in their family meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs will never be <unk> and they will never have to be a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have they <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't have their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new career.
The profession is a family doctor from the company, the business of the business, who starts with you in your house, on your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects started, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do this, and I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I was <unk> --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a business <unk> economy.
So planning is the kiss from the death of the corporate spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to give you no question -- privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then you will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you over this morning.
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution, <unk> <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we have <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people, and <unk> about what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses. And the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very long, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise, they will not come to talk with you.
And then you have to offer absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And later you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- you have to have a great financial <unk>
You know what?
We have never known a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've studied and looked at the 100 companies of the western world, <unk> Edison Ford, all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one person was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in bars with their dedicated business environment in bars next to their dedicated gentleman who speaks to this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who is asking you, what would you need?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools, with simple tools, templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always find relief with the giant electrons that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It will always sink to the music.  There's a quick <unk> in New York   The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest entire world's <unk>
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And it made me deep gratitude for time and lived in time.
It gave the most significant thing of my current life.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let go through the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old new friends and new friends transform the wall of this house house on a giant slate and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die.
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect about this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die of dying I want to be <unk>  Before I die -- I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before I die. I want to sing for millions of people."
Before we die. I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Now, let me die of dying -- once more."
Before I die of dying I want to go to the <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> It's about giving me supporting reflection and <unk> and of remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the art center, we made a kit and have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that makes us more power.
And when you think about the death of our life, our life.
Our spaces shared can create better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, people surrounding us cannot only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
It doesn't talk about, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it by <unk> it will happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice this is never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words that I couldn't even <unk> I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year in which every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would stand in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the concept of a society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although not consider it inside of it, that could only mean one thing -- that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual is manifests in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that are faster in the world, there is no cause no cure anymore.
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing washing machine, and eating anything that had <unk>
As I was growing up, it would come back more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> -- there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child who sees the world without <unk> a human being that had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, which is communication and love, and I realize that it's things that I wouldn't want to change by normality.
<unk> spends about the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift inside of us, and honestly, the search for <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the shift dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been to be <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a communications teacher, which would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  Really <unk> of these students with their great minds, its big books and big books and very unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door in a new world.
Just as I sat when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening up that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientific and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy care and health care, among others, and if we don't know that we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, for please, <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can make it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and that his engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that I do to do.
Instead, as Einstein, said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging in ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways to hook up with their content.
And when I present their work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets -- the bullets and killed the presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but that it's supported too much in the language of our brain and we were <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective than the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand whether you lose a little bit, and then provide the graphics that we would bring into our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key to that you can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
It just sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for a public charge no matter where he <unk> or a very beginning, and that, when he wins, does it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's a advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics are interacting -- I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, your leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it the <unk> State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with it -- they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of it, <unk> because this debate would be reported for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the failure and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call it the King if he was giving him to him, or he was going to give her to her ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title of the title before, but it only meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious degree with a ridiculous degree and insignificant title as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads <unk> the world's largest economy and a fleet of aerial vehicles, and so on.
The reality and the story has taken the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looked at it, well, it was a uniqueness for time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate was and the House of Representatives is because no one is going to be feeling humble when you tell you that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and what I'd like to do is <unk>
politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes a lot more than the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to an underground mine in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and <unk> and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive.
Like the others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light attached to his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter which drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
And I took my hand and suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and fell <unk> meters on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole at risk their lives without paying no reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they're probably never going to will, because they're prey to the slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 continents in over 70 continents in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> at the <unk> Peace Summit in 2009, I had the <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been engaged to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as a degree.
When I ended up talking very bad -- I felt really bad -- I was glad to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me like <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
And so I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, it will lead the dirty ones.
A conservative calculus says that there are now over 27 billion people in the world.
It's twice as much of the African Africans during the whole of all of this <unk> slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk>
But now you can afford to support entire families for generations for 40,000 dollars worth 18.
<unk> slavery generates profits from over <unk> 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake promise of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without paying violence, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods.
slavery exists in almost all the world and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met <unk> <unk>
This weird and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> families -- in a heavy pile of <unk> stack in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> for the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> I did just pee was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot, it became too hot, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera is getting a lot better treatment than these people.
Back at <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't you do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this not just me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles per <unk> to the trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge them and the children put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> and ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that these are slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were sending their freedom, the <unk> they had completely <unk>
When we hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness that was told that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was told by women who had been previously <unk>
And I was driven by a few <unk> stairs which gave this <unk> dirty <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- are forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From foot in <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> fear in that instant, barely could imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a little bit of the stairs where I <unk>
There was no gates <unk>
There were no windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a <unk> issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, is going around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 children and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often interact with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families on the trade of silk trade.
This is a family portrait of a family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and stick the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me its stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
You know, however, we can get out of this house one day and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
I saw what was a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers -- some younger brothers -- some younger kids, makes sense of it?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families -- <unk> and they were forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with a little bit <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of tree trees plunged into Lake <unk> and they often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, they are thrown into water to unleash the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and because his whole life has been treated with cruelty, he tries to the younger slaves under her command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working from a whole degree.
<unk> and <unk>
And you can see that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where he <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk> can happen.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> who suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to do it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would join us out of the car, and he asked the driver which would come out quickly.
Then he pointed up this path barely and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that I would take the path and after walking around an hour of an hour we found that the way was captured by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> turned out <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up to their backs and, while they were looking for gold -- they were in water <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells have to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to be able to extract the gold.
The site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the margin we see that we see the other ones that are less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of the injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When they die their uncle, <unk> it would be the debt of the uncle who will be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, it's got tuberculosis and, nonetheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he had to be liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the face of a remote possibility -- which is very inspired by respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll have testimony to them and to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as humans, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not in magazine -- they're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful, <unk> people I've had the great honor to know.
So I hope these images wake up a force in who you see in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire, and that fire will make light on the slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I want to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We would give us the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But ballet demand an extraordinary training level, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a ballet dancer dancer being.
Over the last few years has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a severe <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure will be when we have an objective and objective <unk>
But it is frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam they could do ourselves?
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to do is that I want it to be a really conventional form of a try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration of the elastic elastic <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds like speaking -- we can imagine as dancers from a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed -- <unk> for example.
And as they did -- they require an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound of sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as it <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> strings of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice of the clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something gets a cost of constant cost, there is a mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address address.
We can reduce the patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> <unk>
Very high monitoring we could get goals.
We could do it <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
So when we take the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without <unk> can call at low price and put recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six hours of goal only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's get together taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people will say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data -- in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors for real markers for the disease.
TR: You've got an precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work, and now it has shown that it works in mobile phone phone phone too, what the project is, now we have one 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We are <unk> in the dark, in Alzheimer's rooms, and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do to the thin thin models, the perfect skin is even more perfect -- we make it possible and we get it in the press in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with a lot of experience with a lot of experience, and a real taste of the images and the picture.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th I traveled to <unk>
It's a little bit of fishermen town located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the early peoples affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
They were <unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools took the mud and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and <unk> cards and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
Let's take them to different places of the peoples of around the <unk>
It wasn't until then, I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As he went on the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of it, and I had the honor that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going beyond myself my horizons than something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think of how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl must be <unk> with very precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not look like her, and that would be as tragic as I had the photo <unk>
With the step of the time, they came by luck and more <unk> and they needed to get more <unk> so it was in Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 <unk> people volunteered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people <unk> of <unk>
In Japan, at July, we would give us a <unk> neighbor village to the north of <unk>
Once we use the week we use our scanner in the early operating libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on course of the <unk> of the photos.
I could have an hour. I could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw all of your hand using as you guide the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures brought together in saltwater, saltwater, covered of bacteria, with algae, and even oil -- all that along with the time I continue to be <unk> by the time I continue to be a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford this picture unless it was clean up, and she would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had a <unk> <unk>
We tell the guidance of a neighboring <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were kind of lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her, but he stopped realizing that the <unk> even further.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have dealt with it, we were able to put the images into a single picture and take it the whole picture.
When I picked his pictures he shared some of his history with us.
A few of her husband found pictures on a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
I took a week to find all his family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his son at least for 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something that I could remember the past that would not have been marked on the last day, when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs, the big <unk> -- the vast majority became the hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families -- totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most in ink for <unk>
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take to look at, but the first thing that we would take to look for.
And this was about this project, of restore small pieces of mankind, giving back to someone of their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to them with something larger, giving back something, using their talents for something that doesn't be nice skin models.
To end up I would like to read this email that I sent him Cindy the day I came from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> around a baby, <unk> my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, my mother, I was just <unk> on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple exhibition in just a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion into motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> over there from the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and put it on and put it into a <unk> <unk> in a second or so, in several ways, create a <unk> <unk> of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet ago.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons flood that photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  Remember that all of this is actually in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel to light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a <unk> <unk> starts to <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Part of the light gets <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounce inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the thoughts in the bottle, then it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a common and common bullet and we make it go down the same distance and see it in slow slow down to about 10 billion times, how much they think we'd take it to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow slow movement.
And what about proving with nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table of the tomato tomato and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more of this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light leaves the tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato of it is <unk> and the light bounce inside and it comes back after several <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture to low exposure, it enters very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than just the shortest exposure -- so I can barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very fancy <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
If a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could get those multiple light bulb <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and you get the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quick, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the <unk> objects but we don't know what point corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser project you can record a photo, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is around the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see inside of the body by having a <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of visualization to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself, a scientist, became science in art, an art of photographs of photography.
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collected every time is not just scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see.
It will create a new form of computer photography with slow and <unk>
And let's look at those ripples -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk>
But here's something that's fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, I would have loved this image.
The order in which events happen in the world sometimes happens to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can break your life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, you move it up to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> in pursuit of a change, had a mobile cell in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile, <unk>
<unk> a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every <unk> <unk> every provider of all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or your Internet vendor
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone to and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of East Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that then was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to you, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all blah blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to put a lawsuit in court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, I was looking at a deal.
They took demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court Court ruled by the German law of the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly ugly thing with a CD inside.
And there was this.
Thirty thousand dollars -- 30 lines of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and go, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> on <unk> and how often I call it the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they're called between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to each other, and we ended up with this big network of communications network.
You can see how their people communicate to each other and what time they call each other to what time they call each other.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leader had never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe I'd never happened.
And, as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today state agencies and businesses want to store as much information from us as possible inside of us as possible.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives, and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When you go home to return to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, they go back to your representative for just because the companies and the state agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that tells you to remember that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi, guilty. What's going on?
It's not enough.
Hi, guilty. What's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
And I would ask my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we will spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that I happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not an inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas Day, they're in the shopping mall, drive in circles and looking for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places empty place empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
If there was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, woman, a disabled living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Rat Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same starting <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
Many people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and I realized that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the last note -- we all had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five to put my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
The other tactic that I used to do was hang a dollar in front of me to get it out.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion that has gotten a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be every family --  I think no one realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as opposed to campaign.
The people that I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that would die of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that it had enough fat fat to live three months without eat, so <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends wear <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> milk on my back, and I would put me up hot cups on my back, and I remember that the water would be inspired by the eyes and I thought <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before you do yoga was a stand-up comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can tell you in the head.
My parents took this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college by positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
I would all love me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classes and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four o'clock <unk> I ultimately will have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end, I finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying in historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask me why and she told me that because they thought I could not make the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't make the risk, you can't make the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to an actor without <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disabled papers.
When I graduated home, and my first <unk> tour was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> didn't look at me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the business directors, not <unk> actors, and not white, with disabilities.
It just empowers perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour of my New York tour, he took New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he realized it was at the high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, no censorship and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my father of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind you to remind the directors of <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I went like invited to the news program, by wire back with Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
And I looked at the director of the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I hold on my head desk to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was sort of <unk> full-time and hit my chair.
Something kind of fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get away from me or no child and no older people.
All of a sudden, my disability, on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online -- like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested I would also add my disability, to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't do someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope together we can create most positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, I will make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We probably need the entire society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity to give children Palestinian children a tiny bit of what my parents taught me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
The <unk> drives small people to poverty and on the brink of <unk>
No for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the <unk> of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no work, no more future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you give him a man who gives him to <unk> him after dinner, <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, who gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
I present to a young guy.
He finally house.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That child of that little town with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little town in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for me.
I was waiting for a opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity of the city, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of the five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they are not providing opportunities -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to <unk> to violence, to be the story of cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
Not quite anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I had forced myself to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house a youth leaders in a corporate market.
We brought up to 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate graduate college college, it was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to <unk> A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> wrapped up with local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand a hundred <unk> over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit and I think that creative spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> of <unk>
It helps young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities they are looking for as dear lives.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to tell you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you give somebody to someone, "When did the last time you saw flowers.
For those of you who grew up during civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he began with the delivery of flowers for wedding and by creating gardens in the houses, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the young families can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, the innovation really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, we inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit that is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to deal with the development and put in their business <unk>
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need to give us the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, private spirit is something more to start a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their <unk> is this is how it calls it when it's created, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and feeding their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks from the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in upstate New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we could just pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed on a beautiful lake with a beautiful lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- aluminum -- aluminum <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and I would get a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, and it's about 11 tons of waste.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does this feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through her routes and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a step further.
So I started working like <unk>
I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong you are <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies keep taking away the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every single weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Statistics <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass it around around you.
They just want to be <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature in the back.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
I find that stigma is particularly ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in terms of efficient and effective <unk> every day, this begins to take advantage of their <unk> and their dangers inherent us in very real ways.
We had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing -- we don't have space for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when they are in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out his relationship.
And then this is what I call our everyday average rate.
So I mean just at the speed that we used to be used by moving into contemporary time.
We usually don't have to be <unk> and we have to take our cup of coffee, our bag of coffee, our water bag of water.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it takes for it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe help to reduce the stigma and we will invest in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way to relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, I grabbed my little son and I went down the stairs running the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycling paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> We worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species should have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the real human cost of the labor labor.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see somebody whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, and you get a moment to get it out.
Let's take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to thinking about our community life forming a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging world, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
In fact, they share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Petersburg.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to take a lot of energy because the lining of <unk> generates heat inside the interior, -- so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And thirdly, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to open air where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to to inspect the site, which is located in a very much growth zone, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the entries from the building.
And this is spread out of a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to open air in the building that is <unk> by its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space form.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be attached to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also from the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center.
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the mall because in order to end up there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but it was also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short about every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting up <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we thought on the roof as a new public space with areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is collected water for inner gut.
It was expected for the early early year, because we're going through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master <unk> plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project that is so big, the biggest thing that I ever designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> wall connected by nearly straight.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets and creating 12 similar early blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors of doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project -- like the apartment, as a part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we would make a framework that ensures that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks of <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up greater density at higher levels and lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving out the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can come up and forth and make activities like running a <unk> career in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes to local communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect the nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had lots of very bright hair, and a little bit of cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in a time after the <unk> was a little afternoon, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took on the table of my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I put out the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Exactly.
So all the blocks --  And I set up to bring back the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them up to all rows of <unk> and myself a row out of that, just because they were there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never gave up.
It was all obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I would tell me the reason why I would really bother me that this little girl and so small was so good for <unk>
And I <unk> jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, birds tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause for spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the laboratory in which we study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
There are no Shakespeare.
I took the lists of reading reading at high school, because we would lose "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy, no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost that has all of them.
This year was 100 years of his masterpiece, "In pursuit of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, but we suppose it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious because the jealousy, that is reduced to the person, their wish, for their <unk> are a well-known narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel cultures, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being when storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details of <unk> to <unk> right?
<unk> make us all novelists and <unk> and that is something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure could give me pleasure maybe right now."
And it starts to be said to know that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that would <unk> detects in his lover, he adds it to its collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful -- <unk> links well the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy, soon listening to the doors of the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover, then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "It's all scientific research with true value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the tracks toward the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who may be able to protect us.
It's telling us we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular <unk>
Is there any other emotion we would give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was being consumed with the idea that her woman would get it.
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or possibly accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity and <unk>
In fact, the more intensely we are, we are, more we became the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts of violent or illegal acts of it.
The <unk> they are taught to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight years -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account in Facebook since he was sent <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
Every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge is <unk> right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how they do their minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of your being and <unk> from what you ever do, and it's under the floor -- you get your name, takes your <unk> empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live at the time of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when you're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker Street Baker and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinks on Professor <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we would do it and do it with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all over with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to give you your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> really is a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk>
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only <unk> fiction jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> the invites the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Proust <unk>
We are in a <unk>
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the left of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the surface gray is the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a couple of a 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities in the government.
They died people, including <unk> crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program was <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which he escaped after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They did not brought a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at University of Rice <unk> gave us a better idea.
John F.
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why scale the most famous mountain <unk>
This is 35 years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why does it play a Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they are simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> of the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the transcendence of the technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and we eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> which Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with a ship, but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew at 40,000 miles <unk>
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of the technology has been <unk> by seeing that we have to see that the technology we would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population seem to have a result of it.
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the <unk> <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn up.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that has happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found us, and they were <unk> with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have widened and <unk> our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation that in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies, <unk> from the years to be asked, Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in concrete, the incentives that the capitalists of risk offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused us to <unk> the creation of ideas -- for the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at the height of the high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment, minute than they could leave in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies as energy as energy, which need a huge capital and development of the development in the long term. They also haven't invested in the development of technologies intended to solve large problems because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption is coming from sources like solar energy and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, business entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties are going to develop the development of a <unk> energy increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there's no hope in political climate that we will see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for time that famines are result of failure in the tool of food.
But 30 years of research has been taught that famines are political crisis that affect the food distribution that affect food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and storage of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
And finally, the big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared him a war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can have it and we need these four elements of being <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem: the institutions must want to support the <unk> should be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the technology of technology to solve great problems, it is true with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the ideas of <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> in our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, it's a very general thought.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get rid of trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why don't people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I turn it to think that there may be gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be quite <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence enough?
What record polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people would look like when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
I probably said, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very strong response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some of you no."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to safe <unk> confidence.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> <unk> or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the reading class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a higher way.
I think these surveys are really bad tools to measure the true level of trust, because the real trust of real trust -- because they try to embrace good judgment in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an inspired target.
This is not the goal that I would look at.
I want to get more trust in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm a <unk> not to trust what's <unk>
And I think that those people who were buying their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart objective in this life.
You are deposited on top or <unk> that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yes, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it is is about making a judgment on how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw stuff, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we could trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I see your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it is, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that we were easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will be going to be <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and we will think that the system of accountability which is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may have all of you who are similar examples.
<unk> all that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trusted to be worthy of being worthy of trust and encourage people that are safe and if we were trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve trust.
But the confidence in short, it's very obvious because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the base enough to be trusted.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> it for all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to give us evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, do the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The grocery store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> it without giving explanations ...
I carry them up and get the money, or change it for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we are pointing is not something that is very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worth trust.
Thank you.
From the beginnings of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly becoming increasingly more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the <unk> display its physical body to the pixel up.
Designers can make their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science and Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a real digital area.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with the depth of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift your hands out of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor down every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us?
We had a lot of us would have bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it to be physicists in a way that we can <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical bar.
This <unk> magnet, it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically distance and <unk> shot from Michael Jordan can be played as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to <unk> ourselves from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you had a <unk> that barrier, the only limit that has left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Copernican Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a way to the <unk> and a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer China.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could do to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But no adult would tell us the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was already too much more to train.
My dream was never <unk>
We would argue that for the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about <unk> Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject to another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap and <unk> the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture gave me a place to my reading <unk>
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map seemed to me outside because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the research camps like comparative comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it as well as life <unk>
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> by Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are financial and politics and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> duty.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of being lost in the translation, I found that it can be won a lot of it.
For example, this is through the translation that I realized is that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used or powerless before.
Having a dream <unk> really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that uncertainty is not the only purpose of sleep.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until an <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So, the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch of my office took off my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the biblical stories, that Alex brought to the <unk> made me easy to move my head while I <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and why I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, they get home later, you have kids later, even the death later.
<unk> as Alex and I had time to <unk>
But soon after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who I'd talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with the guys under your category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No no, but maybe it's <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex going the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody gets to age without going before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take sleep a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. <unk> the <unk>
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
That means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that are given that they shape their life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that they <unk>
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, or they live with their future couple future 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from themselves, now is time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top of the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them over your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years is crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of <unk>
The researchers call <unk> a extended adolescence
<unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you get <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, smart, interesting people like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship matters. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My dates during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
Everyone running, they were all running, but then at some point around the 30, he crashed the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was staying standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it's not <unk> the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you will start a career, to pick a mate, and to pick a mate, and have two to three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is a research that starts to show you, which is a lot harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle class crisis is not about buying red car cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
So here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, she came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she was getting herself up, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning I had a lot of <unk> but then he stayed looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> by <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if he gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't mean, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like I was just sitting in the time and sit in the early 2000s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every man or a woman, deserves to know.
First, I said to Emma who will be pulled out of that identity crisis and the identity of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity comes from identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to give it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make it back.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are just limited to who you know about, how do you think, how talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes out of the outside circle of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call a weak ties of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have any work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs we never created was never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last but not less importantly, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as she was growing Emma soon to go back to her family, when she has a partner and form her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit on mind that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to pick the person that you live now, or let you tell you, now when all of the Facebook start walking towards <unk> not progress.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be an conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing is going to work or kill any time with whatever you do to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a <unk> roommate who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link actually helped him get a job there.
That job offer it a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events of events in museums.
This married a man who elected <unk>
He <unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the emergency emergency spaces are not good enough to me.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes coming out of the airport in Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> your <unk> get out of identity <unk> using your weak move, choose your family.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management consulting for a job that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I went back, I would save grades.
What struck me was that the <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance, don't have credit <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be so good.
And that set me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a perceptual perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
Is it the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults across all kinds of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied the teachers <unk> working in very hard neighborhoods -- which teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
partnered with private companies, asking ask, what are these sellers going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, a feature of a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't the <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not just for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination and then I waited for more than a year to see who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher likely to be known even when they were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most striking thing about determination is how little we know, the little bit that we know science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development for <unk>
What should I do to teach children a solid job work in work?
How do I keep it motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not following on their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly related to us or is even related to backwards to talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, I'm going to finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all of new lessons with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new new way of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic would add 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for it.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read traffic <unk> <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of web pages.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how this method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol actually is <unk> from the shape of the flame -- but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
<unk>
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old West Side <unk>
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks to make a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a lifetime of your arms, this person is saying, <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> -- because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two little together, it gets very hot.
Three lanes, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun goes on the horizon.
One door. Get a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Was there somebody at home?
This person is getting hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each little effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple hundred characters -- which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun in the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two <unk> stacked over the other.
In ancient China, it meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and download the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the lithium magician together.
The film took her imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress dress and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand to him.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of a complex fantasy level of <unk>
However, the <unk> magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> kid would join a girl dressed as the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the Oz of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz of Oz today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as <unk>
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the <unk> produced by the original <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the one thing in Oz is that the most attractive characters wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so she was slid in the room and was impressed as a mom who was standing up in the room and was impressed as a mom who was understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So I have a sense that Luke joined an army to overthrowing the government?
So we did this with the <unk> <unk>
How do Dorothy your movie?
By doing good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be <unk> OK?
Why is there that so much gravitational capital yield in the movies for our children, and so little of the <unk> brick path.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected them to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and stand for the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though them, they are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of every day continues to appear in classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember the criticism when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let it get the <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has no roots and already <unk> but maybe we start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of <unk> on the <unk> of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do -- in the film, there's more of a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than <unk> <unk> <unk> Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that is a movie of Hollywood <unk>
<unk> doesn't test <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film that happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and is the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films more popular, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to lead to this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
So this is what it was saying.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a huge amount of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing -- we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to do it.
We have tools in our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would say that, but I have to ask, "Can you say <unk> -- if at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily about parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Star <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looked like that his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician as a <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was looking for sea biscuits at the coast of Maine, because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was stuck with <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized to my own eyes not enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles away along with <unk>
And my sea fortune had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we can use the <unk>
This is a place located in the east Delta, of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using <unk> and we actually process it using a brilliant pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes in the <unk> of the <unk> and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital, for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is sitting in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of old art, and architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, I moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I will try to find it at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a place map of the place with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly <unk> area, you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location location, five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years passing back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire and these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's get the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire probably written in <unk> <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Now, share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do all the ideas happen in this really began in 1984 <unk> <unk> in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the aerodynamic search for marine <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we have a group of <unk> <unk> on bicycles.
They're competing in a race and bicycles race and go in the direction to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide with the door to their home.
There are bicycles flying around, the wheels that go on to the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
And the hall to the hall, or whatever there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light glows on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I talk.
You can feel your blue <unk> to tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're going to get into the mouth.
They went on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's little clothes to dancing on his head <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The land has been covered with a yellow brick path and from the oven coming to you -- <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that is conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of a few different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
The names of tens and tens of strangers.
You have entire poems to be made in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena in nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and it has one of the best memories, <unk>
I said, "You know, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise person.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
And we said, "We have trained them to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old <unk> invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their addresses, and that medieval academics used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How do you have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, but a little bit of <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory extent to us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We went together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on the memory of something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say that they have changed our own cognitively <unk>
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory that's this amazing competition of memory.
It's not that <unk> there is a <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College London invited a memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know -- it will be brains in some form of structural or <unk> or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control of control with that <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, they would take their brains while they were looking at numbers, and they found that in the memory champions they found that in memory champions we are moving parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed to be a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The competitive tournament in competitive automobile is driving as a race race in where someone has a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
At his desk in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> -- absolutely all the techniques used at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- <unk> says the next word. I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, "You have a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Well, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
Do you think about what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity.
What about here?
Well, the <unk> name doesn't really mean for you. There's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They do well when they come home from working.
You probably put some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to get a <unk>
He stood up to stand up with his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> is <unk>
Let's get all of us.
But not only killed everyone, but it turned out the bodies of <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
And so they couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I was standing outside, only survivor, in the outside of the rubble, closed his eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting next to me.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers, word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional <unk>
If I told you that the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to say who I was sitting on the horse or the brown speaker in your lobby, be able to be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and images of images with things you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it from memory, the same way that would have done it, if they'd been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely <unk> image that is absolutely ridiculous, crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on top of Mister <unk>
And that would remember that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then I fly in the kitchen, and the fourth thing they would talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like <unk> <unk> <unk> their addresses, which is not word for word, which is going to confuse them but, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
Actually, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing about is when someone got off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before sit at the New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about doing is making more and better the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on with this.
This is me, using my standard test team, for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security card covered with tape, leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back back to the same contest that had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be able to put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice power to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they are based on rather basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from how their minds works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You know, when we focus deeply focused on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even shortcuts.
They work because they make us <unk>
You know, a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, this is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what we're willing to lose from what is already our short <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side, are going to be so <unk> that we won't even be able to deal with it in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are some incredible memory abilities all over us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would just take a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> <unk> I was six years old and living in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom of a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then you all spent the time watching television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody would see me -- and every time I got it, and I would come back in a towel -- I all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not safe and <unk>
<unk> that <unk> I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of these areas that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under top.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot of it.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would think about, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think that because it was based on a building that has built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in the U.S., we use it to build houses.
See, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it's very complicated.
The people who have <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library. The <unk> of <unk> that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this thing round -- beautiful brick and red brick -- that they are trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the body values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, to the other side of the country, got another library that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects who are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's lives.
We gave them back and we gave them so much, we get away from the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we are dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go on the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> we make it swing backwards and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 300 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
Let's bring the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that you like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we use a bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned it into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> of glass.
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those love could be <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
You may have a little bit of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can visualize memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making a swing again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new new design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that we are going on against other forms.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and general public, they were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 thousand percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> <unk> angels, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these shapes wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
They did the biggest mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This is in the beginning of the new millennials spent with other star architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the back of the new millennium, actually started to go through with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how they consume architecture.
thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, it means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know if that he designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen.
My theory is that when you apply media to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until getting in both extreme extremes in <unk> and actually actually the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product, and it was exactly the product, and there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media medium, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians <unk>
If that building builds up today, first <unk> the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> with examples of <unk> innovation, what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and to tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library might be.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using word <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience who doesn't have anything that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that <unk> pendulum from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning are going to be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> of red brick in the basis of what a <unk> should be.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make a sport or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that go to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more smarter and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not online <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the most competitive spaces of the local libraries the homes where we form our children, and the step of the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does that very cool way from the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
You laugh and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
So apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And he did think, when did I stop doing this?
How is it that we are suddenly comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, I just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
He's preparing for next week, in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, although his mom tells you all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Between what her mom tells you and what his friends, or in the school is, you don't know who to believe.
So a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others please leave a <unk> "I am nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a regular and <unk> teenager and stream, which gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable and emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be available and available all the time, talking to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
We've never been so connected, we have been so connected in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures coming from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what the digitally.
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a every day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The technique of <unk> is now a routine.
And trends are like, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things start to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls would prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as we take society and to the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five isn't attending at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the waiting season, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're beautiful enough, you get a note less than the average of your fellow people who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people are.
So in order to be clear, we're talking about how you see you -- not how you are really.
The bottom of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with times making less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, making them not healthy that they can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more inclusive decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, sexual activity, early and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're <unk> again, regardless of if they have no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe in the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that try?
We have this potential for interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are so many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of them don't work.
I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children is not only going to have a positive impact but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical starting points for any willing to provide an education on body self-esteem that works.
Education is a fundamental thing, but address this problem requires each one of us that take charge on the issue and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution from our politicians into <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of a <unk> athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people who are not because you see them.
We can all start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can help people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When did the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their children to grow their own individual, <unk> diversity, <unk>
Do we have to put people in really making the difference in a <unk>
It's going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be seen as the ones that they are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is your mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
It could just be just the woman who is two seats, what it would mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice into his interior, -- that he would like him to do not have long legs long, <unk> a smaller belly -- little more little feet.
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would give it to the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is attached to us.
But let's bring our children to the truth.
It <unk> that the way you see you is just one part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They beat self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year's age of today, become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially it would be innocent -- but being a prisoner for other minor charges on company, they started planning attacks about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be avoided.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> mother, a primary school teacher among the two guys made everything possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims get to meet.
By the experience I saw that when people take time to interact with it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a small fraction of the people who are going to be so <unk> to their convictions that they think we need to use all the possible media to everyone lived like them.
A few months before her arrest himself sat with me and explained that in the last week he and explained that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to training at Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point to the target about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot him and gave her little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all of all, especially mine, all the goal broke into flames.
My uncle turned into the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, such child.
All of all, the comment made them a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they found that funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the North Trade parking lot from the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was time to pack and go to another town.
As I was always me, the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new class of the class, quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in my house reading books, and playing video games.
For these reasons they didn't have developed social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was opera, opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I put to test my mind is for the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been the victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the boys who we had done, was Jewish age.
It took several days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life had been done to me believing it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience is fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all of the gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, developed a sense of empathy towards suffering from others -- but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, like, exactly the way I want to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be honest about my <unk> and he helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation. You have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that keeps in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of somebody who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is going to take you to the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way that even though I was inspired to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has led to them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking against those <unk> acts, as rejection of my father.
With this simplicity I put me here as proof that violence is not inherent about any religion or race, which children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D <unk> and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It's emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
He has memories, like some of your childhood you project into your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film -- you, you and you.
There's nothing to get more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not mindful of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science is by nature, it's objective of it.
<unk> by nature, is subjective <unk>
Then you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we would see that vision.
Science was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience was studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is time for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of science in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience or feeling pain or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations for.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds a few questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the central mystery of this <unk> why is it all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all kinds of emergent behaviors, how they operate <unk> how the <unk> work is <unk> and they adapt the living organisms, and they're all questions about how the goal works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain like a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it's all <unk> is accompanied by an authentic experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still has a lot to say.
I am a heart scientist for heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, on my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that will work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain of amazing explanations -- we get used to this -- physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology, explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea of our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness is right now, is sort of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of crazy crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there's no such problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain human functions -- the behaviors of your brain -- and this is all studies that it needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denial that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as the core building space, the space and the mass.
<unk> laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of anything else.
Instead, they think of principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- mass, -- mass laws of Newton. So I applied the basic law of <unk> and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, the time, mass, charge -- then by the question of logic, we have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to make the consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path to make it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the mass, the <unk>
So physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental fundamental laws that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental fundamental laws that we could do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the microbes -- even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anguish when they think <unk> always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some sense of crude <unk> some of the primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anybody think that <unk>
In part of this one crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems like a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that make sense of thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There is always information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of integrated information into a system.
And we are supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a similar degree of information integration of information, as well as a significant degree of consciousness rather important.
But when it comes to worms, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there's still a different level of consciousness than zero.
In fact, this is a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to adapt our relationship to nature, and it can have some pretty serious social and ethical implications.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get too much hungry.
I think it would think, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact that consciousness and its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are in some pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of our world -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED collective -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that at least is a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing than the second is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally figure it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an area of education.
I went to school, I was stuck with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a community reward.
And my parents said, "Well, that's really nice -- but there's a problem behind it.
She has actually no anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the middle class, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
"Please the <unk>
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration objects.
And we don't know it, and it's not because of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, the disability people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I'm going to see what I do in this wheelchair and probably you are waiting for you to give you a little bit of them -- right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they've been sold to the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability you do.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, because of my life, it could be worse.
I could be that one person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you believe that I'm brave or an inspiration, and this was happening before my job had a public profile.
It was like I got myself up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attributed to people with disability in benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually really hard.
I have a few things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you might think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was inspired by a call of the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we're more disability because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So is it really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold to this lie that disability makes us exceptional us.
And honestly, I don't know.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration and the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not at least inspired by something like me?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am lucky than that.
It's a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load your phone battery on the car battery.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that has been sold to the disability is the biggest <unk>
We make us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a van has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen won't make the subtitles for people who are <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and make a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low <unk> expectations of people with disability that we will be <unk> for rise of bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where I value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in 11 grade school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is an <unk> user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football, with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just responding to one of those questions, so please, it won't be wrong.
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know knowing that, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what's going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the <unk> <unk> <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pounds of 110 pounds <unk> trying to match everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I would take some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the hull, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is an submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
<unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the soccer field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players -- and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you certainly know most of you already know.
The Rift City <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why this video video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a roller coaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will the experience of a fan of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running by <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network? or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is their experience when you pull out of a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they would get the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
You know, augmented reality is augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see information about what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on the <unk> technology.
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore was put together a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I was putting radios on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to the group, and you see the next move shown in front of you, in a plastic source of plastic you take on the ground -- you don't have to worry about losing a <unk>
Or for <unk> the strategy.
They just go out to the field, and you get <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose party parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already been working.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have information <unk>
So this is <unk> to good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will be also <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
You go to a open receiver -- suddenly, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you are going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It's going to be the protection area.
Another <unk> I'll tell you that there's an open radio.
He <unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
The ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land. However, the receptor sees the bombsight an area of grass on it and can change the race.
He <unk> catching the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and <unk> have followed the move from each of you.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> as our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth of gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live being <unk>
How much does it be for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than the notes of notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I was given to me after 23 years in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the southern tip of <unk> County that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is true of its beautiful views.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer a head of head to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will take another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact is broken into bone, some of which we prescribe vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the people who have this method of suicide <unk> will realize <unk> death and death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel into the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the most dark time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
It was <unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on July 22 last year by getting a call from a <unk> subject sitting in the nucleus near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a <unk> officer.
Jason had only 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After close to one hour talking to <unk> I wondered if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and smart boy in New Jersey had just given her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how she was.
The parents of Jason had been asked by it.
Economic damage affects a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved being <unk>
What do you do?
What to say?
In my experience, not only have to speak, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't be <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because they probably don't know it.
I just stand there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing life, you've had these <unk>
They put the person in front of the front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and that they never go to <unk> they will believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments from realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared as the night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk up the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean hope and value.
On March 11, I wrote to a radio call for a <unk> subject on the front page near the northern tower.
I took my quiet on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next hour, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to find that day back to that lane go back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, I read it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and gave her hope and life else.
Do you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking to you and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother, and I got that letter with me, and I would like to get to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events in March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin still keeps us.
Honestly, I think Kevin <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
You thank God for you.
I actually do with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General at San Francisco at the night of San Francisco that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I had to get it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, I have to end up his own pain, giving me a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
You just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked her about an hour.
For that time, I got my hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that most people we get to contact with this bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second you leave the railing they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to be able to do this to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but you know what you are, and a question you know what you are like, how do you bother that?
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream I'd had since I was a child.
My outside finally will come back with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I will go over to the most evening, when I look at this picture, I think, we got him <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, I am just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs that surround us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
He recorded me as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom was, "Why don't you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to do it.
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped myself share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but why the world is all about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who just accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture, that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you participate in the contest of <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and the wardrobe <unk> and that night, he won a bath, he won in <unk> and she was a third a finalist between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I passed my request from the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you join the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was interested, in Thailand at 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do surgeries more than sophisticated and safe surgery.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to have surgery before we changed the name before they change the name before they change the name before they change the name before they change the name before they change the name before they change the name before they change the name before they changed.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who was <unk> lived his truth, but he <unk> he ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every third of November we do a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who are <unk> and stood up by injustice.
These are Marsha P. He's Marsha Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without embarrassment and fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day there is no longer more than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So first, thank you for all my <unk>
The support network, to my parents especially, in my family, which itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been going to young women who have been <unk> who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that her parents could not accept it, and I would take the phone called my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the theme that sometimes that assignment, and there should be a space that allowed people to go, and this is a conversation that we should have with with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known to their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who met her for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education to defending her rights in 2007. And when they took their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality of violence and exploitation.
You see, in today's societies right from the beginning, when at birth a little girl, his birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome for his father, or his mother.
The neighborhood comes out, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot to have a little girl.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of one child, when I was born, her third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother, but the daughter was only <unk> when it grows, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school admits of their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it's 13 years old, you get to get out of your house without a male.
It's confined to four walls in their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were to take the code of that of course honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of code of honor, not just affecting the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
Is it the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It should be silent and it has to be silent and accepting people's decisions and mother and people's decisions even if it doesn't want to.
If you hit the guy with a man who doesn't like or if you hit her with a old man -- she has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> really young -- he has to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
What happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and <unk> and then light to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when they came to me, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl <unk>
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many of the developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for life to do.
<unk> in a school means your identity and his name.
One set of school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of tourist <unk> and it was in the relative to family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters in any document.
That was the reason that I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was able to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to show her in personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys as well.
I used education for <unk>
He <unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, supported by more rights for women, and they were able to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls have been banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
Musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and raised by the right to the education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, offered her himself for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and October nine of the October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would give her to the ear of my wife and "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
You know, your life in play is because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't start asking again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains, because his facial nerve nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give it good. Please don't get away.
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl <unk>
<unk> when they didn't end up their task.
They fight her siblings, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me, "What is special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
I did what I didn't do.
I didn't cut its wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google Google group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still just as smart or not?
It's not going to be a <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much more than a dozen of a dozen chemical powerful every day, because if it didn't take anything, you would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to live with life.
I have saved a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get the dose dose -- because it really doesn't exist a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started testing different mixes and I was amazed by how small changes in the dose, we dramatically reduce my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly controversial case for a few months, I tried a few months and chemical <unk> for a man in the 1900s, and I was surprised to see how I would look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all of the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of different types or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just wouldn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to <unk> -- since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do about making the <unk> those hormones and those <unk> and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
And I think almost always in images, and that became my key point in the key point -- how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> and new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes can see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thought <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> it really makes it very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in achieving this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning system.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, and functional resonance imaging to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his Harvard colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who sees an image.
The backbone of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as being used by looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the English Jack lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were tracking their brains to create a large feedback pool in the brain sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as they get a new <unk>
And the computer using only the brain brain information -- it would show you what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're just close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This has been done with the world's biggest resolution systems, today, and its resolution as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer myself to that.
Many are proposing new technical techniques, new projection techniques, even I am, with the recent result of the MRI first, we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, most <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution, not for thousands of ways that we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the biggest magnets -- let's make better magnets.
Can we create structures that are much more complex <unk> slightly different <unk>
Why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions on <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and radio radio frequency radio systems in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, they were able to make magnetic patterns connected, which are available to radio radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing processing processing processing processing processing -- the information you can get into a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid of blood -- but the one of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity is sleep.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices than opening up this door.
Anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His self may be telling some person for the first time you love it or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have all of us in life.
And all I think is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and having come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side Side -- a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> for the <unk> of my little short <unk> and I would get my head on my head, I was usually asked by a little bit of a kid who was like, "Hey, you're kid or <unk>
And it would show a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look.
But I would not say anything, and I would go inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
So, that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
I was a familiar silence -- but this time I was able to get around with the female issues at the table.  I was the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," you know?
I would take a look at my eyes and I went down to my backs a young girl with a pink dress looking at me in a little bit like a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're kid or <unk>
So I would take it down a little bit again, I put out <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know that this is confusing.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it, they just go, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation ever to ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color looks like.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my self is not different about yours or yours or yours.
I'll give you 100 reasons about why coming out of my closet was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard not to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared a broken <unk> is harder to tell you that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder to say to your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only hard.
We need to stop to classify what's hard to do with something that is hard for another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what they're made on your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian to fight any child in four years to go to coffee.
I was frozen in the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet, <unk> my gay, <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around for purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> lady in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> at Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite drive, Will <unk>
And you know who would be <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait for desperately to show his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts -- <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find it, and to realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you might get.
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask for anyone who has been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means is that you get out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other people must be able to know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, you know.
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be influenced by that.
And some of them can come out wounded -- they can get out of what they've done, but they're never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark trivia <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- a famous example of how intelligence has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is so interesting as the question of if an submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of the computer pioneers as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the Earth or the Earth or the Earth or the Earth or the Earth or you can look at the Earth, they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see how to develop a physical theory that explained how, to a certain point in time, the asteroids that we prescribe the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question of understanding the natural nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for development of universal states that we prescribe the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic move, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, for a number of years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can get out of all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options with a force -- with a force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, accessible, to an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open choices.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, "What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that make more mess, or beneficial during their life they should have tendency to be more favorable conditions for intelligent things like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence, a more controversial relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlates with the production of entropy production, but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system where you find it inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple testing of animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even making money <unk> actions, all that without being allowed to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance applications have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
It's widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, which is their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the ultimate network right now.
This is the same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the pathways of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense energy, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of generic actions, successfully increasing assets under their economic management.
The risk management skill will have massive applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- the <unk> labor, there was always the concept that if we were smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion that there would be <unk>
Machines would get against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> to the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's the opposite, that the impulse to take all the possible future is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence of the intelligence, that the general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how is it that we look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants to help us build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the breakdown of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, over the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is pointing to the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go through the front of them, and they turn a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their might.
At the time, this gives it clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds that our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the fastest recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us since we've been now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world to show this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface in pursuit of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are linked to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places we really have to do compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> places on the Earth, the air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets to get a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief and the belief and the belief and the belief and the belief and the belief that we are waiting to save this <unk> <unk> the only planet that we know is really habitable Earth.
And so I like the exploration of exploration -- I'm deep with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to help humanity is like to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will come to us that the party actually will have place later on <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for competitive exploration and climate preservation are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They only find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain space spaces, into the hostile areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the <unk> paradox.
A lot of years ago, Enrico <unk> asked me to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life to right now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we prescribe this development.
It's arrogant to think that just colonization, <unk> save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to deal with the hostile environments to Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I had my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining room, where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all closed.
I thought I call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I could not go home from my friend of Jeff to go through night because I had a flight early in Europe in the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure they were not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, well despite the circumstances, I was right over.
I am a neurologist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate increases the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in place that would be able to put bad things on it.
Or at least, if bad things happen.
So I set up to think about that, but even a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny was shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and trying to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could get out badly, then you try to figure out what it can do to stop things or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, we will take a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to address the location of the important things, where the same well, where the fish are, which places the <unk> trees live, where the female tribes live, and they live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they <unk> the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved brain of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, you know, reading and <unk>
So at home you put a place for their keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a petri dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it all your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards a picture of your credit card cards from driving, you're going to drive off the mail for them to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved decision to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the medical decisions and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the one that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and your cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most intractable drugs in the world today -- even more likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not out of the doctor, and if it's someone's fault -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to deal with the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke, or another <unk> event.
Now you might say, "Well, one probability in 300 of the <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and is, you know, the effects of <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things like <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this with time, so you don't have to make the story of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug to help your medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethics needs it, is part of the informed of consent consent of it.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe they're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needed to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the biggest men in the top of 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number necessary to deal with is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just take you a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before time, the questions that you can ask that we will do the conversation forward.
You don't have why to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you get a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react quickly. They might be the lunch of the lions -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future of how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor -- I settled on a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of email messages I haven't read about.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization as a process of <unk> and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: It's my favorite musical symbol.
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never come to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time they mixed up with local signs, and it was developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
I now realize that it's not true for nothing.
Sound is a very important part of my life, in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world -- is like I lived in a foreign world, to just observe blind their rules, identify behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the one?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Not <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure it <unk> <unk>
I call this a <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag on what the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines have already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art unit.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited a museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I was from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There were no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience that visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that well I could help myself and my artistic work, or I could get it up.
I chose to make me <unk>
There's a massive culture around verbal language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is like I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers in <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, in addition to <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to be able to do it in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So, with sound like my new, artistic medium in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note is not able to capture and completely express in paper.
And the same can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the form of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you were <unk> only one <unk> at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in place to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a <unk> would change the chord it would make a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with the music in terms of tone, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you break it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign the sun comes out and <unk>
This is my day."
If you put it up and do the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said about <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how they express time in <unk> and how the distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one is more close and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> at four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at the <unk> right hand, <unk> right hand.
We have <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> yourself time."
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please push it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job all.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but they transmit meanings very different.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very fancy world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have the sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what it defines the social value and allow <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to learn how to learn to learn the music.
<unk> is a rich trove trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to encourage you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you've got to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because the adults would tell us to protect us from the horrific truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the others.
The country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk around with lots of junk waste.
So as good citizens, cleaned up <unk> and not it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans in the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those little bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and they <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years old, dreamed of inventing a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work of work with <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My work is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
So we decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids are getting a lot to the robots.
Then we quickly created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned into the lights and web cameras, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see those pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer board process this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an equivalent estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention to step on a website for a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will take it even further.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to bridge immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they were <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is going down, where the place they live.
You can also see that water is brown, and the mud and the oil are also brown color, and when they're <unk> it's very hard to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what is in the water.
So let's take this prototype with a sensor, and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to test a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help <unk> to other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe I could address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took a bunch of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear fraction of the water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 metric tons are still filtering out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure radiation from <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has safe side, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and production independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we put into the center of <unk> here is the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, strategies, and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder will sink from the top of the mountain into the <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the nearest nuclear nuclear central power.
We are approaching about a hundred miles of the nuclear core, and with the fishermen help in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a prescription of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into the greatest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal -- a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become actually with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of age transforming their standard wheels into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, <unk> creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes of <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of steel, the other one of a silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one thought of it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the raw, he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
<unk> was only tool for Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all of the information needed it for every cell to work and to make it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in the wild.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are most thick with small <unk>
One acts mainly as filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here is a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work today between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right, analysis, shown in the two screens after me.
My job at the most simple level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask you now? Why now?
Why couldn't this do 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where you have four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet your minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, products, structures and tools and tools at large scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> of diameter with a protective basis that one day not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphics from <unk> genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient Arabic architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is <unk> to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion in Paris with <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> with no seams of the cells. I show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution and the <unk> instruments that are allowing it to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural and also that absorbs sound.
The Carter <unk> my collaborator, came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
It is <unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the dots in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious home religious home but when I was young, my grandmother tells me stories from the Bible Bible and one of them left me, and he came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, including leaves and <unk>
The entire tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with twigs, crust and <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world in fact.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if objects did a piece of <unk>
Do you have a better state of <unk>
So we're looking for the material that we would look at the kind of material in the tree with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million metric tons are produced every year as a shrimp, or crabs, or <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune in your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We did a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to make a broad range of properties, from <unk> hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that we built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a half a material -- a half feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it stops you to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process that was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out without problems with <unk> and if it broadens even more than even more.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the Blank <unk> we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the <unk> of liquid -- only instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> -- new biological biases, new biological channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the water ponds and fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human experience.
One turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, it will never be <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract tract -- which will help us make these bacteria and to make it out of their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we get more transparent channels.
So this digestive system, <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it goes down 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our very <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside of the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> he said, "We're the past half -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase our alive?
And if we could create personal <unk> that we would make our skin -- you know, <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer made material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, I mix those fibers in each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm is turned into the environment, creates a tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when I put the silk worm on a flat patch on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we had a flat challenge and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that form, the composition, the structure of <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> and their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we can shape the brutal silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we actually opened this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that with silk worms to be more dark and <unk> so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, and that silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get to <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready for us with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
The biological silk -- the biological silk about <unk> silk is given all this pavilion to their integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route as well.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature in nature inspired by the first time, which is for us, for the first time, we do charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question you want to be from <unk>
It caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had a <unk>
In school I liked English and <unk> and art and gathering websites and found a website, and also playing the guitar in an punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, so I've spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling is no longer challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it to you.
But then I came up with something else, something totally different, and I get stuck in it, and I'm going to be <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This is a whole range of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why I caused so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me is not <unk> at all.
I was afraid to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and you feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have me back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned from culture.
You ask ourselves, "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would say to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
I would take a <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done again and again as we grow up in different ways, <unk> <unk> high school students are asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of <unk> before the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be, not inspired to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are good <unk> they may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned out in <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to engage in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up his curiosity and a lot of different things that he wants to do?
There's no place for someone in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
It could help you divide into three <unk> multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would look at the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the early time the ideal was the ideal was the <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
You have any term you like or <unk> yourself in your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his interests in cartography, visualization of travel, travel, design <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of its own <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> them <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and leave our zones of comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> time and independent writer and <unk>
As a pianist who was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quick <unk>
Before it turned to the writer, it was <unk> financial <unk>
It had to learn the fine sales mechanics when they started their practices, and this ability to write compelling launches for the editors.
They rarely have a waste of time to go to what you ask yourself, even if at the end of the <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. It is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other websites, sometimes <unk> on Kickstarter, sometimes <unk> and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a different <unk> depending on the needs of the customers.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability like the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the market needs -- those who are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
knowing the belly -- knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams with a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we would all have to design lives and careers that we're going to do with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part are told by just being more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing you take out of this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep in curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I had a woman named <unk> and led it to a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until she passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If I had a <unk> I had been living today, we could not give her more help than he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that now we call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it has been moved on to Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimers now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of the two of them.
In other words, there is a probability that goes through your years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be dear with Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs in the <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other diseases because we have less time and money on the investigation of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar amount of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time that people know, but everybody is <unk> Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of us, and the scientists, is banned Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by crude Alzheimer's brain life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that fold as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds down, these dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are in the outside.
This makes the molecules in protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We have spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and identifying what step you can block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
You know, others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced to the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, physical, engineers, mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick into each other, as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial outcome -- but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be <unk> that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and that if we get it, we can get it.
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and inclusive people pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
I was talking about them and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the column called the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it myself myself as a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be <unk> to be 36 more and more personal questions and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When did it be the last time you would get to another person?
And <unk>
They have <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number five: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or she or it -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever known.
When I first came across this study a few years ago, a really really struck me, a matter that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance of testing this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
And yet, we were going to go and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column of a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably asked you, they are still up yet.
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because you've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was <unk>
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been asked to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of view.
And that came up with a good amount of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it came out, I had no idea.
The paper was published on Friday on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And on Sunday, I had called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was like, I was to say something, little enough, for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing <unk> about their own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to find that life love of a has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or write what they did every day for weeks, they always were doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox to my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers -- like this.
I was getting interviewed on radio and <unk>
I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk> is?
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable on it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first drive to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public onset together.
I was looking at television interviews and <unk> orders for two of us two.
I think it was afraid to become the icons of becoming the icons of <unk> a range for the one that I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked, and they wanted to know if it was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, especially people asked the wrong question.
How do you know whether to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions, in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal students, among college students, using what they were doing, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic sounds right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer to do several later and several later studies, they were also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community and used it among people of <unk> political care.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, who combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
I said, "You want to say that you would tell you from the person with whom I <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that yes, they managed to get better known to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to have all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or could not be living without it.
So I turned to science.
I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could somehow be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just did research for the book that I wrote in, but in retrospect, it seems to really be <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt that way.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance -- not only to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> silently for the person I love.
It may be that this guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate something of the risk of <unk> and this is a very scary story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that asks, still together?
And their content with an answer or <unk>
So more than a question, I want to ask you more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do I stay in love with things like <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more controversial conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love -- it's not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- the love didn't happen.
They fell in love with love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think we would have two times to take that decision, and how it would have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, and I have chosen to love somebody who was so generous, and a fun and <unk> that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I <unk> and what maybe I will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to see the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> and a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time ago,  -- something that really hit me but more details later on.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
He took a box of wood, and you put a dollar ticket a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment because I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from field and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I put more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to increase the size as if it was that we will get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, weird bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find on the street, all I could find out because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk>
And I got out of the objects, and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can make an idea.
Then I made a few insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of the natural size of natural human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use it.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that forming a three-dimensional composition of them.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by most of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is where creatures with animal heads are headed to the <unk> lists on the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a god <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things you can see if you look very well in the ocean.
We're also sort of a <unk> species.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand you get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a little bit of a bird, like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail.
Anyway, its tail turn fire into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that do you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> made of terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
It's very <unk> over time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be translated into dictionaries or <unk>
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a human form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. It's taking years.
Each is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a kind of an trapped in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest, can be <unk> the <unk>
I will submit it to the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the chest <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> as the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a <unk> a musician, a musician, a musician -- a musician, a radio, and a school, a school arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people on it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries of religion -- of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has to have effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and the most effective system for any medication in the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they have to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and you will increase the counts of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, it's mostly negative because in the time that it takes to be able to get to your current stream -- it will be <unk> and worse in the time that it takes to get to your destination, which is where it's more important -- in the HIV decline.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the <unk> system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily into the blood stream that will be supported to regulate therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life running through the entire time.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Could I get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care about wounds and surgery, they can be used for anything, including <unk> transport of drugs.
We're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes that open and closed almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You best ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit powerful and powerful beam of laser on the cellular <unk> while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or on plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it heads to the place of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, no armed organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and studying ways of encouraging violent participation to violent participation to violent <unk>
I do business work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we should even be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and white policies are <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
It's multitasking now.
<unk> a complex communication machinery of communication, radio radio stations on TV websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising hedge fund fund but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit and build their brand.
Men are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by the war or even the <unk> of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to bring safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a mass European price for the population.
But generally providing social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow them to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in 2006 cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps in terms of government, and they emerge as armed groups, political groups, engaging in the violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, we can see it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all of its functions, collect the garbage, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations of nations without state, and the more weak ones are the states, as in the Middle East and <unk> that gap the <unk> actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in a <unk>
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
So if we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives offer to foster violence from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors <unk> the military power can win some battles, but we won't give peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that safety vacuum to fill that safety vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My views about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label it would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would tell me as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me step back.
When I was a young woman, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> who might be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and taboo word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asked too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it is equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman to realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also a proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It was the same paycheck for the same job.
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use it to be easy and accessible to the contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or abstruse <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have on account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, and a lot more.
We have to have into account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and it offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin 103 <unk> is incredible.
He <unk> with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical own.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all that I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks, but they also kill insects, the <unk> <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It comes out of fashion magazines and the beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales, they make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
This problem.
<unk> feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, and working workers, gay women and <unk> in favor of white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist ...
It also happens, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we were going to be right.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where they <unk> them.
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to have this <unk> before I try to put me up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> for fear of what that tag means -- because they could not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fulfill
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
Over the last few years it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show that was going to see this star <unk> embracing the feminism star openly the feminism and to know about the women and the young men that be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics begin <unk> if we were <unk> it was or not a feminist.
You know, their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection is because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so much so <unk>
We're so much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to deal with the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> aspects, or most okay, more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little more brave.
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until we really understand their change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has its music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions moves, this makes it harder for women to achieve gender equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
They're two <unk> <unk> and shiny and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And they are amazed by strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sports, and <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio box when we hear the songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than as a <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it includes a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a more broad range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we tend to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help them to be even more as well as more as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision drivers.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without having these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions are coming to the top, to people in the power of directors and producers of music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant.
We can also assert with courage -- good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist unless it is <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say it about everything, because I was <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A little bit of kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have a brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other one, I propose that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when more you need to be a <unk>
Just after last year, I <unk> children in California had <unk> for being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the cool things that this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal to a child with a immune immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak of <unk> they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that followed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase in autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates followed by only three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising NGOs like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers for Disease Control Center on what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis, and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnosis of diagnosis, they had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and <unk> progress of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked at 11 young patients who looked at the people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun during hours by shaking their hands on their faces, but they were dependent on panic for <unk> like when you didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients treaties in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as major authority of the world in the world, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as it comes to the references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
It was once <unk> that he had become nine from every 10 kids sent to her office to be autistic and without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been careful in a refrigerator that doesn't get <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I had two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite disks -- he says it properly, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning invisible to the world in general.
It wasn't until the decade of 1970 that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers who were <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and warm and <unk> and they had an autistic autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith who decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study prevalence of autism in the general population.
You know, a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these children didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost about trying to make sense of their data.
How did anybody have noticed these children before?
But then I found a reference to a paper that was published in German <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> the next year to the article -- and then he became buried buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no even a translation translation to English, but luckily, the husband in <unk> was German, and he did it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with an integrated school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in her clinic started with music exercises with music, and the children followed their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism causing autism, described as disability -- for life that required <unk> and space <unk> throughout the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
And since I went back and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their change changes in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> for a wide <unk>
These changes didn't fall in a broken bag.
He <unk> when I went through and Judith and Judith <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I was going out <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a little bit of a little circle, reported by experts knew what autism, but after the acting performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected to be out there, so that the people with autism, and their families will finally support the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for increasing <unk> a simple, powerful and <unk> story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the estimate of the prevention of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are right on the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are by solving by the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to standard standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers who have support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
