# ## Word Vectors
# 
# Word Vectors are often used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g. question answering, text generation, translation, etc., so it is important to build some intuitions as to their strengths and weaknesses. Here, you will explore two types of word vectors: those derived from *co-occurrence matrices*, and those derived via *word2vec*. 
# 
# **Assignment Notes:** Please make sure to save the notebook as you go along. Submission Instructions are located at the bottom of the notebook.
# 
# **Note on Terminology:** The terms "word vectors" and "word embeddings" are often used interchangeably. The term "embedding" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) states, "*conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension*".

# ## Part 1: Count-Based Word Vectors (10 points)
# 
# Most word vector models start from the following idea:
# 
# *You shall know a word by the company it keeps ([Firth, J. R. 1957:11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rupert_Firth))*
# 
# Many word vector implementations are driven by the idea that similar words, i.e., (near) synonyms, will be used in similar contexts. As a result, similar words will often be spoken or written along with a shared subset of words, i.e., contexts. By examining these contexts, we can try to develop embeddings for our words. With this intuition in mind, many "old school" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/vectorsemantics.video.pdf) or [here](https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285)).

# ### Co-Occurrence
# 
# A co-occurrence matrix counts how often things co-occur in some environment. Given some word $w_i$ occurring in the document, we consider the *context window* surrounding $w_i$. Supposing our fixed window size is $n$, then this is the $n$ preceding and $n$ subsequent words in that document, i.e. words $w_{i-n} \dots w_{i-1}$ and $w_{i+1} \dots w_{i+n}$. We build a *co-occurrence matrix* $M$, which is a symmetric word-by-word matrix in which $M_{ij}$ is the number of times $w_j$ appears inside $w_i$'s window.
# 
# **Example: Co-Occurrence with Fixed Window of n=1**:
# 
# Document 1: "all that glitters is not gold"
# 
# Document 2: "all is well that ends well"
# 
# 
# |     *    | START | all | that | glitters | is   | not  | gold  | well | ends | END |
# |----------|-------|-----|------|----------|------|------|-------|------|------|-----|
# | START    | 0     | 2   | 0    | 0        | 0    | 0    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 0   |
# | all      | 2     | 0   | 1    | 0        | 1    | 0    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 0   |
# | that     | 0     | 1   | 0    | 1        | 0    | 0    | 0     | 1    | 1    | 0   |
# | glitters | 0     | 0   | 1    | 0        | 1    | 0    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 0   |
# | is       | 0     | 1   | 0    | 1        | 0    | 1    | 0     | 1    | 0    | 0   |
# | not      | 0     | 0   | 0    | 0        | 1    | 0    | 1     | 0    | 0    | 0   |
# | gold     | 0     | 0   | 0    | 0        | 0    | 1    | 0     | 0    | 0    | 1   |
# | well     | 0     | 0   | 1    | 0        | 1    | 0    | 0     | 0    | 1    | 1   |
# | ends     | 0     | 0   | 1    | 0        | 0    | 0    | 0     | 1    | 0    | 0   |
# | END      | 0     | 0   | 0    | 0        | 0    | 0    | 1     | 1    | 0    | 0   |
# 
# **Note:** In NLP, we often add START and END tokens to represent the beginning and end of sentences, paragraphs or documents. In thise case we imagine START and END tokens encapsulating each document, e.g., "START All that glitters is not gold END", and include these tokens in our co-occurrence counts.
# 
# The rows (or columns) of this matrix provide one type of word vectors (those based on word-word co-occurrence), but the vectors will be large in general (linear in the number of distinct words in a corpus). Thus, our next step is to run *dimensionality reduction*. In particular, we will run *SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)*, which is a kind of generalized *PCA (Principal Components Analysis)* to select the top $k$ principal components. Here's a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words. We obtain a full matrix decomposition, with the singular values ordered in the diagonal $S$ matrix, and our new, shorter length-$k$ word vectors in $U_k$.
# 
# ![Picture of an SVD](imgs/svd.png "SVD")
# 
# This reduced-dimensionality co-occurrence representation preserves semantic relationships between words, e.g. *doctor* and *hospital* will be closer than *doctor* and *dog*. 
# 
# **Notes:** If you can barely remember what an eigenvalue is, here's [a slow, friendly introduction to SVD](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf). If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, feel free to check out lectures [7](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [8](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), and [9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf) of CS168. These course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms. Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as *[Truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Truncated_SVD)* — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively.

# ### Plotting Co-Occurrence Word Embeddings
# 
# Here, we will be using the Reuters (business and financial news) corpus. If you haven't run the import cell at the top of this page, please run it now (click it and press SHIFT-RETURN). The corpus consists of 10,788 news documents totaling 1.3 million words. These documents span 90 categories and are split into train and test. For more details, please see https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html. We provide a `read_corpus` function below that pulls out only articles from the "crude" (i.e. news articles about oil, gas, etc.) category. The function also adds START and END tokens to each of the documents, and lowercases words. You do **not** have perform any other kind of pre-processing.

# In[2]:


def read_corpus(category="crude"):
    """ Read files from the specified Reuter's category.
        Params:

            list of lists, with words from each of the processed files
    """
    files = reuters.fileids(category)
    return [[START_TOKEN] + [w.lower() for w in list(reuters.words(f))] + [END_TOKEN] for f in files]

# ### Question 1.1: Implement `distinct_words` [code] (2 points)
# 
# Write a method to work out the distinct words (word types) that occur in the corpus. You can do this with `for` loops, but it's more efficient to do it with Python list comprehensions. In particular, [this](https://coderwall.com/p/rcmaea/flatten-a-list-of-lists-in-one-line-in-python) may be useful to flatten a list of lists. If you're not familiar with Python list comprehensions in general, here's [more information](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Comprehensions.html).
# 
# You may find it useful to use [Python sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) to remove duplicate words.

# Write a method that constructs a co-occurrence matrix for a certain window-size $n$ (with a default of 4), considering words $n$ before and $n$ after the word in the center of the window. Here, we start to use `numpy (np)` to represent vectors, matrices, and tensors.

# ### Question 1.5: Co-Occurrence Plot Analysis [written] (3 points)
# 
# Now we will put together all the parts you have written! We will compute the co-occurrence matrix with fixed window of 4, over the Reuters "crude" corpus. Then we will use TruncatedSVD to compute 2-dimensional embeddings of each word. TruncatedSVD returns U\*S, so we normalize the returned vectors, so that all the vectors will appear around the unit circle (therefore closeness is directional closeness). **Note**: The line of code below that does the normalizing uses the NumPy concept of *broadcasting*. If you don't know about broadcasting, check out
# [Computation on Arrays: Broadcasting by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.05-computation-on-arrays-broadcasting.html).
# 
# Run the below cell to produce the plot. It'll probably take a few seconds to run. What clusters together in 2-dimensional embedding space? What doesn't cluster together that you might think should have?  **Note:** "bpd" stands for "barrels per day" and is a commonly used abbreviation in crude oil topic articles.

If you're feeling adventurous, challenge yourself and try reading the [original paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf).

# Then run the following cells to load the word2vec vectors into memory. **Note**: This might take several minutes.

# **Note: If you are receiving out of memory issues on your local machine, try closing other applications to free more memory on your device. You may want to try restarting your machine so that you can free up extra memory. Then immediately run the jupyter notebook and see if you can load the word vectors properly. If you still have problems with loading the embeddings onto your local machine after this, please follow the Piazza instructions, as how to run remotely on Stanford Farmshare machines.**

# ### Reducing dimensionality of Word2Vec Word Embeddings
# Let's directly compare the word2vec embeddings to those of the co-occurrence matrix. Run the following cells to:
# 
# 1. Put the 3 million word2vec vectors into a matrix M
# 2. Run reduce_to_k_dim (your Truncated SVD function) to reduce the vectors from 300-dimensional to 2-dimensional.

# ### Question 2.1: Word2Vec Plot Analysis [written] (4 points)
# 
# Run the cell below to plot the 2D word2vec embeddings for `['barrels', 'bpd', 'ecuador', 'energy', 'industry', 'kuwait', 'oil', 'output', 'petroleum', 'venezuela']`.

# ### Cosine Similarity
# Now that we have word vectors, we need a way to quantify the similarity between individual words, according to these vectors. One such metric is cosine-similarity. We will be using this to find words that are "close" and "far" from one another.
# 
# We can think of n-dimensional vectors as points in n-dimensional space. If we take this perspective L1 and L2 Distances help quantify the amount of space "we must travel" to get between these two points. Another approach is to examine the angle between two vectors. From trigonometry we know that:
# 
# <img src="imgs/inner_product.png" width=20% style="float: center;"></img>
# 
# Instead of computing the actual angle, we can leave the similarity in terms of $similarity = cos(\Theta)$. Formally the [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) $s$ between two vectors $p$ and $q$ is defined as:
# 
# $$s = \frac{p \cdot q}{||p|| ||q||}, \textrm{ where } s \in [-1, 1] $$ 

# ### Question 2.2: Polysemous Words (2 points) [code + written] 
# Find a [polysemous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) word (for example, "leaves" or "scoop") such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contains related words from *both* meanings. For example, "leaves" has both "vanishes" and "stalks" in the top 10, and "scoop" has both "handed_waffle_cone" and "lowdown". You will probably need to try several polysemous words before you find one. Please state the polysemous word you discover and the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10. Why do you think many of the polysemous words you tried didn't work?
# 
# **Note**: You should use the `wv_from_bin.most_similar(word)` function to get the top 10 similar words. This function ranks all other words in the vocabulary with respect to their cosine similarity to the given word. For further assistance please check the __[GenSim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html#gensim.models.keyedvectors.FastTextKeyedVectors.most_similar)__.

# ### Question 2.3: Synonyms & Antonyms (2 points) [code + written] 
# 
# When considering Cosine Similarity, it's often more convenient to think of Cosine Distance, which is simply 1 - Cosine Similarity.
# 
# Find three words (w1,w2,w3) where w1 and w2 are synonyms and w1 and w3 are antonyms, but Cosine Distance(w1,w3) < Cosine Distance(w1,w2). For example, w1="happy" is closer to w3="sad" than to w2="cheerful". 
# 
# Once you have found your example, please give a possible explanation for why this counter-intuitive result may have happened.
# 
# You should use the the `wv_from_bin.distance(w1, w2)` function here in order to compute the cosine distance between two words. Please see the __[GenSim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html#gensim.models.keyedvectors.FastTextKeyedVectors.distance)__ for further assistance.

# Write your synonym & antonym exploration code here.

w1 = "happy"
w2 = "delightful"
w3 = "sad"
w1_w2_dist = wv_from_bin.distance(w1, w2)
w1_w3_dist = wv_from_bin.distance(w1, w3)

print("Synonyms {}, {} have cosine distance: {}".format(w1, w2, w1_w2_dist))
print("Antonyms {}, {} have cosine distance: {}".format(w1, w3, w1_w3_dist))

# ### Solving Analogies with Word Vectors
# Word2Vec vectors have been shown to *sometimes* exhibit the ability to solve analogies. 
# 
# As an example, for the analogy "man : king :: woman : x", what is x?
# 
# In the cell below, we show you how to use word vectors to find x. The `most_similar` function finds words that are most similar to the words in the `positive` list and most dissimilar from the words in the `negative` list. The answer to the analogy will be the word ranked most similar (largest numerical value).
# 
# **Note:** Further Documentation on the `most_similar` function can be found within the __[GenSim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html#gensim.models.keyedvectors.FastTextKeyedVectors.most_similar)__.

# ### Question 2.4: Finding Analogies [code + written]  (2 Points)
# Find an example of analogy that holds according to these vectors (i.e. the intended word is ranked top). In your solution please state the full analogy in the form x:y :: a:b. If you believe the analogy is complicated, explain why the analogy holds in one or two sentences.
# 
# **Note**: You may have to try many analogies to find one that works!
